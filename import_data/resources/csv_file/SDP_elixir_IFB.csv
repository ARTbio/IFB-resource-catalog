that a significant change between different samplings of the population of events/objects.

The service computes a relatively simple mathematical formula the computer implementation of which is tricky and subject to overflow. The originality of the service is thus the test (this is the sole existing on-line server for it), and its extremely robust implementation.

Three tools are provided:
Tool 1: comparing a pair of counts
Tool1 requests a pair of counts of a given event and the sizes of the two samples. Tool1 returns the probability that the compared samples contain the same
proportion of that event. Tool1 is also helpful to determine the suitable combination of counts and sample sizes required to diagnose differences
reaching a given threshold of statistical significance.
Tool 2: comparing lists of paired counts
Tool2 compares two lists of counts associated to the same set of events drawn from two samples and determine which events exhibit the most
significant differences. An optional normalization procedure is available for overdispersed data. 

Tool 3: pairwise distances of multiple datasets
Tool3 performs the complete set of pairwise comparisons of multiple lists of counts (associated to the same set of events) all at once, delivering
an interactive heat map of their relative distances.


","Tool

","ACDtool is a freely accessible web service (URL: www.igs.cnrs-mrs.fr/acdtool/) proposing 3
types of analyses: 1) the pairwise comparison of individual counts, 
2) pairwise comparisons of arbitrary large lists of counts, 
3) the all-at-once pairwise comparisons of multiple datasets. 
Statistical computations are implemented using standard R functions and can accommodate all practical ranges
of counts as generated by modern omic experiments. ACDtool is well suited for large datasets without replicates.","Anybody can take advantage of the use of this test in the context of any activity involving counts.

The original implementation was targetted towards genomics and transcriptomics. It can be used in a much wider context including population genetics, proteomics, metagenomics, barcoding, medical practice, social sciences,  economics.","Human data (including Rare Diseases, Copy number Variations, Human cell Atlas)

"qcGenomics","MENDOZA PARRA MARCO ANTONIO","Genoscope; UMR-8030","François Jacob","2 Gaston Crémieux 91057 Evry cedex","marco@igbmc.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","Modern functional genomics studies relies on the combination of massive parallel DNA sequencing with chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (known as ChIP-sequencing) or a large variety of DNA-RNA enrichment strategies. Indeed, over the last ten years ChIP-seq and related datasets generated by the scientific community have accumulated in large repositories such as gene expression ommnibus (GEO) or the European nucleotide archive (ENA), representing massive amounts of data which are publicly available for further mining. 
Importantly, data mining over datasets issued from different laboratories, conditions, protocols, sample treatments, etc, might require a critical evaluation of their associated quality (herein corresponding to the evaluation of the signal/background contrast), an aspect that is under-estimated or addressed by simplistic qualitative approaches. Specifically, while a number of analytical methods aiming to address the quality of ChIP-seq datasets have been described, none of them has been shown to be applicable to the large variety of ChIP-seq and enrichment-related NGS profiling assays. In contrast, our proprietary NGS-QC algorithm has been designed to (i) infer a set of global QC indicators (QCis), which reveal the comparability of different enriched NGS data sets, (ii) provide local QCis to judge the robustness of cumulative read counts ('peaks or islands') in a particular region, (iii) provide guidelines for the choice of the optimal sequencing depth for a given target and, finally, (iv) to have quantitative means of comparing different antibodies and antibody batches for ChIP-seq and related antibody-driven studies. 
Currently, our database (publicly available at http://ngs-qc.org) is hosting quality scores for more than 80 thousand profiles, corresponding to virtually all ChIP-seq assays generated by the scientific community, but also other type of functional genomic readouts like ATAC-Seq, DNase-seq, RNA-seq as well as long-range chromatin interaction assays like 4C-seq and Hi-C.
As consequence, the qcGenomics platform (available via the web address http://ngs-qc.org) represents currently an emergent infrastructure for the scientific community, followed by more than 13800 users (since April 2014) issued from different regions on the world (>1000 users from USA; >500 from China; France; >460 from UK; ~200 from Germany; ~180 from India; ~150 from Canada; ~100 from Japan; etc). Furthermore, in addition to 5 scientific articles published by the team of qcGenomics (NAR 2013; Genomics Data 2014; F1000Res 2016; Statistical Genomics Springer Book Series 2016; BMC Genomics; 2016), 38 citations making reference to this platform are available, clearly demonstrating the interest and the utility of our database to the scientific community.
Furthermore, this database is currently evolving from a qualification to an integrative platform, in which users can (i) retrieve public datasets and their associated quality scores; (ii) visualize their enrichment patterns into our dedicated genome browser where local quality scores are also displayed; (iii) compare up to hundreds datasets on the basis of (pre-computed) similarity index scores; (iv) characterize co-occurring events by the inference of combinatorial states in a genomic context. A manuscript describing these new computational solutions available in our platform is under preparation.

Overall, these solutions - available under the qcGenomics platform - provide to the scientific community, means to interrogate public data without the necessity of directly recovering the raw data, thus decreasing the hurdle associated the necessity of having the computational skills and infrastructure for it, and by consequence making the mining of this type of data accessible to any laboratory over the world.","Data
Tool
","qcGenomics recovers publicly available raw data (fastq files) from GEO by the use of our customized scripts. After reads alignment to the corresponding genome, our proprietary NGS-QC algorithm allows to infer local and global quality scores which are then made available to the scientific community, together with a curated version of the available metadata (the curation procedure is composed by a machine-driven strategy for the identification of the cell/tissue-type, target molecule associated to the dataset, followed by an expert curation process for the identification of the potential cell/tissue type treatments described on the metadata but not easily retrieved by an automated text-mining strategy).","qcGenomics is focused on functional genomic readouts which are generated by the international community.

ReMap has been the first large scale integrative initiative to study these data, offering significant insights into the complexity of the human regulatory landscape. The ReMap 2015 resource created a large catalog of regulatory regions by compiling the genomic localization of 132 different TRs across 83 different human cell lines and tissue types based on 395 non-ENCODE datasets selected from Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress. This catalog was merged with the ENCODE multi-cell peaks, generating a global map of 13M regulatory elements for 237 TRs across multiple cell types.

First designed as a Community Model Organism Database (MOD) for Paramecium tetraurelia, the current version of this unique resource integrates Paramecium genomes and high-throughput datasets for a growing number of species in the Paramecium genus, with focus on the aurelia complex of 15 morphologically identical but sexually incompatible species. Indeed, Paramecium aurelia spp. provide a unique system to test theories about speciation and investigate the long-term consequences of whole genome duplication. Most of the data in ParameciumDB is integrated as soon as it is generated by Paramecium consortium members; the rest is imported after deposit in GenBank or the European Nucleotide Archive. The relevant scientific literature is imported from PubMed and linked to genes and stocks.

Originality
This is the only community database for Paramecium, an important genus in the ciliate clade both in terms of the impact of past and present research (in physiology, genetics, epigenetics and genomics) and in terms of the evolutionary success of the species. ParameciumDB adds considerable value to available data through curation and data integration and is intensively used by the small but highly reputed Paramecium research community, particularly strong in Europe.

Evolution
ParameciumDB will continue integration of new datasets and development of new tools in response to the needs of its user community. 
","Data
Tool
Training
","ParameciumDB is a knowledge base. It is also, in part, a deposition database with private access to unpublished data for the research community. Such data is funded independently of ParameciumDB itself. Added-value comes from expert curation and data integration, in gene pages and browsers as well as tools to search and retrieve data. Bibliography imported from PubMed is linked to genes and stocks. Different data types and views are integrated in a standards-aware fashion. Data from other databases is cross-referenced, so for example ParameciumDB is linked to Swissprot, Gene Ontology, InterPro and Ensembl (for vertebrate genomes). ParameciumDB data and annotations are available through the BioMart Central Portal.","ParameciumDB serves the international ciliate molecular biology community and in particular Paramecium research labs. The latter is small (60 publications on Paramecium molecular biology over the past 5 years as determined using MESH terms “Paramecium/genetic”) but much larger if ecology and population genetics are included. ParameciumDB is a unique resource for this community.

","ParameciumDB (September 2018) integrates data for 17 species of Paramecium and contains 45 genome versions which represent 6To. The data are visible according to the user’s rights (for private data, depending on project and research team) but when the scientific article is published the data become public. ParameciumDB uses modern web technologies (WebStorage, AJAX jQuery, CSS Bootstrap, ...). The 50 different users per day (45% in Europe, 42% in North America and 11% in Asia ; robots excluded) can contact us to suggest improvements or ask for help with a problem. Every 5 minutes a script checks the availability of the service. Log statistics are monitored continuously with daily reports. The entire information system undergoes daily backup to a different building and is mirrored on a server in a different building. Data is stored in a standards-aware Chado database; downloads are in standard formats (fasta, bam, tabular text, json). ParameciumDB uses subversion software for version control during code development and deployment. 
Last updated with a completely new web interface and tools in September 2017, ParameciumDB has a “help” email address which is answered promptly. There is a wiki with information about Paramecium biology, Paramecium genetics and Paramecium husbandry and some standard protocols.

It is an exact local transcriptome assembler that allows to identify SNPs, indels and alternative splicing events. It can deal with an arbitrary number of biological conditions, and will quantify each variant in each condition. It has been tested on Illumina datasets of up to 1G reads. Its memory consumption is around 5Gb for 100M reads.

KisSplice's website (http://kissplice.prabi.fr/) has 300 unique visitors per month.

KisSplice was primarily developed to analyse RNAseq data from non-model species (without a reference genome). 
It is now also used in the case of model species (human, mouse), where a genome is available, but the annotation is still not complete. KisSplice is especially interesting when analysing patient's transcriptomes, because it enables to identify novel (cryptic) splice sites. 

KisSplice has been benchmarked against Trinity, a widely used transcriptome assembler. Unlike Trinity, it does not assemble full-length transcripts, but on the simpler task of identifying alternative splicing events, KisSplice was faster and more exhaustive.

KisSplice was also benchmarked against MISO, FARLine and Cufflinks. In comparison to all these methods (which are mapping-first approaches), it reports many more novel splice sites. It however does not identify poorly expressed isoforms, and exonised repeats.","Tool","The service is not a database. It is a software. It has to be dowloaded and run in command-line.

CRISPR-Cas9 is a highly successful biotechnology tool and CRISPR loci are used to genotype pathogenic bacteria. The CRISPRdb database and services developed at I2BC since 2007 are leading international resources for CRISPR sequences analysis. The CRISPRdb database and tools are composed of five components which can be accessed at http://crispr.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/. The most used are CRISPRfinder (http://crispr.u-psud.fr/Server/) a program to detect CRISPR elements in user-submitted DNA sequences and CRISPRdb itself (http://crispr.u-psud.fr/crispr/) the repository of CRISPRs extracted from public whole genome sequences of bacteria and archaea, and which is already registered among Elixir services. The CRISPRdb/CRISPRfinder web sites are world leading biological resources, with over 50,000 unique visitors/year and over 1900 citations.
In 2017-2018 we started expanding the platform by including the search of the associated cas genes. We successfully developed and published a new CRISPRCasFinder tool to search for both CRISPR and Cas. CRISPRCasFinder can be used online at https://crisprcas.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/ or downloaded for a local installation. This tool has been used to develop a novel CRISPRCasdb, and a web-based program dedicated to the analysis of user-submitted metagenomics data also accessible via https://crisprcas.i2bc.paris-saclay.fr/. The tool was published in July 2018 (doi: 10.1093/nar/gky425) and the page is already accessed by 1,000 unique visitors/month.
To our knowledge, no other equivalent services exist worldwide. Partial tools showing similarities can be found at http://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/CRISPRone/, http://brownlabtools.otago.ac.nz/CRISPRDetect/.
These services can be viewed as annotation tools dedicated to CRISPR and Cas genes search, and as such could be linked to other EU bioinformatics infrastructures.

Data is freely accessible to the scientific community, via a Web application developed with .NET Core, a free open-source, and multiplatform framework (Windows, MacOS, Linux).
Web services are highly available and maintainable, thanks to the following architecture:
-a physical separation of the Apache Web server and the computing server,
-a dedicated Heavy duty computation server (Intel(R) Xeon(R) 64 cores),
-each computation request is sent to a Message Queuing Server (RabbitMq), who distributes the jobs to the computing server for parallelization,
-all servers (Web, computation, Message Queuing) are hosted locally, and maintained by the I2BC informatics service (updates, data backups, monitoring).
-servers activities are stored in logs, used for anonymous usage statistics (Advanced Web Statistics, awstats).
-the web application relies on a PostgreSQL database, storing CRISPR/Cas sequence analysis results, taxonomy, and metadata, for more than 26,000 assemblies (bacteria, viruses, archaea).
-the consultation is facilitated by interfaces presenting the data in sortable tables. Complex filters make it possible to find the desired information. For more responsive interfaces, queries to the database are done asynchronously.
-each assembly and sequence is referenced with a unique and persistent internal identifier (UUID), but is also referenced with the genbank and refseq identifiers. Direct links to NCBI databases are available from the Web interfaces.
-the application queries the NCBI services for new assemblies daily, automatically keeping the database up to date.
-a responsive helpdesk is available by e-mail contact (current contact christine.pourcel@i2bc.paris-saclay.fr).

The main originality of the VirHostNet 2.0 service is the integration and visualisation of local manual biocuration of virus/host ppi data in MITAB 2.5 format and the core data resources or services (including the IMEx Consortium, Uniprot and Interpro, ViralZone) in a network-based framework.
The strategy of evolution is:
-	to increase the effort and the quality of biocuration process to reach the latest IMEX format (MITAB 2.7);
-	the biocuration of virus/host tropism at the species, tissues and cellular type scale;
-	the sharing of billion of pan virus/host ppi predicted by the VirHostPred algorithm.
The first evidence of community outreach and adoption is the number of citations of the resource in scientific papers and specialized reviews (> 170 citations in ten years). VirHostNet 2.0 has now become a gold standard in the fields of virus/host interactomics and beyond (e.g. study of positive selection in human; candidate genes prioritization; systems biology). Moreover it is used as a resource for other database, including HPIDB a member of the IMEX consortium. In addition our team has mined this gold standard resource in multiple systems biology case studies (7 publications, 671 citations). The second evidence of community outreach and adoption is the growing number of Twitter followers since 2014, whose are in a large proportion Virologists (@virhostnet2, >1500 followers). Finally, VirHostNet is now a member of the European Virus Bioinformatics Center (EVBC).
In term of positioning to other similar resources, VirHostNet 2.0 is complementary to other IMEX databases and more particularly to HPIDB 3.0 that focuses on pathogen-host protein-protein interactions. Until now VirhostNet has prioritized comprehensiveness of virus/host –omics dataset by following a fast biocuration process (MITAB 2.5, n= 28.814 own biocurated ppi) while HPIDB has privileged data accuracy by following latest IMEX standard (MITAB 2.7, n = 5.046 own biocurated ppi).

VirHostnet 2.0 is more a knowledgebase system with recognized added-value in term of virus/host ppi biocuration, data integration and network based-modeling. Indeed all the ppi data are combined with other databases in a network-based knowledgebase system which automatically:
-	score the quality of edges using MISCORE algorithm ;
-	compute graph properties of nodes in different network model (host ppi network, virus/host ppi network …);
-	validate the biological meaning of virus/host ppi using virus/host tropism combined from multiple sources (ViralZone, VirusHostDB, Genbank);
-	predict billion ppi for all virus/host species couples.

"MoMA-LigPath","Juan CORTES","LAAS","CNRS","7 Av. du Colonel Roche, 31400 Toulouse, France","juan.cortes@laas.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","MoMA-LigPath (http://moma.laas.fr) is a web server to simulate protein–ligand unbinding. The underlying method is based on a mechanistic representation of the molecular system, considering partial flexibility, and on the application of a robotics-inspired algorithm to explore the conformational space. Such a purely geometric approach, together with the efficiency of the exploration algorithm, enables the simulation of ligand unbinding within short computing time. Ligand unbinding pathways generated by MoMA-LigPath are a first approximation that can provide useful information about protein–ligand interactions. When needed, this approximation can be subsequently refined and analyzed using state-ofthe-art energy models and molecular modeling methods.

The web server is available since 2013. The number of registered users is 281, who have run more than 1000 jobs on the server. In addition, about 500 jobs have been run by anonymous users. 

According to Google Scholar, the article describing the web server has been cited 24 times (5 of which are citations of some of the authors of the paper). Some of these citing papers mention the application of MoMA-LigPath for drug design, particularly in the context of anti-cancer therapies. Currently, MoMA-LigPath is being used in the pharmaceutical industry (ongoing collaboration with Sanofi R&D). MoMA-LigPath can also serve for educational purposes: It was successfully used in a winter school for PhD students in 2013.

Our aim in the short/mid-term is to enhance the tool including the flexibility of the protein backbone, and additional analyses of the solution trajectories.

Two related tools are CAVER (http://caver.cz/) and MOLE (https://mole.upol.cz/). The main difference with respect to these tools is that MoMA-LigPath is not only aimed at finding the access channels, but also the ligand trajectory, considering (partially) flexible molecular models.
","Tool","Two usage modes are available to run jobs on the web server. The ‘simple’ mode is the standard way of using
MoMA-LigPath, and should be sufficient in most cases. The ‘advanced’ mode enables the user to locally modify
the flexibility of the molecules, and to access some parameters of the path exploration algorithm. The main input of MoMA-LigPath is a ‘.pdb’ file containing the atomic coordinates of the protein–ligand complex. The main output of MoMA-LigPath is a set of solution paths. Each solution, contained in a separate downloadable archive, is a sequence of ‘.pdb’ files corresponding to intermediate conformations of the molecules along the ligand exit path. For each solution, a file of ‘contacts’ between the ligand and the protein is also generated. This is a text file containing a line for each pair of atoms in contact along the path. Information on protein–ligand contacts may
be interesting to identify important interactions. For instance, such information can help decision making for
protein engineering.

IMGT® is a high-quality integrated knowledge resource specialized in the immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies, T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility (MH) of human and other vertebrate species, and in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), MH superfamily (MhSF) and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) of vertebrates and invertebrates. IMGT® provides a common access to sequence, genome and structure immunogenetics data, based on the concepts of IMGT-ONTOLOGY and on the IMGT Scientific chart rules. IMGT® works in close collaboration with EBI (Europe), DDBJ (Japan) and NCBI (USA). More specifically, IMGT® uses the same accession numbers for nucleotide sequences as ENA, GenBank and DDBJ. IMGT genes are officially approved by HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) since 1999 and used by Ensembl and Vega (in the past) (Hinxton, UK), NCBI Gene (all have direct links to IMGT/GENE-DB which is the international reference database for IG and TR genes).

IMGT® consists of 7 databases (IMGT/LIGM-DB, IMGT/GENE-DB, etc) and 17 online interactive tools for the analysis of sequences (IMGT/V-QUEST and its high throughput version IMGT/HighV-QUEST for next generation sequencing (NGS), IMGT/DomainGapAlign, etc.), and the analysis of genes and of three-dimensional (3D) structures. IMGT® also provides one standalone and more than 20,000 pages of Web resources. A schematic representation of the data exchanges is provided in the figure given below.

","IMGT® uses the indicators of its Quality Management System. IMGT® has been approved by Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance France SAS to the Quality Management System Standards: ISO 9001:2008 since October, 18, 2010 and NFX 50-900 since October 13, 2014. ""Research, development and provision of an integrated system (databases, tools and Web resources in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics"". These indicators are analyzed regularly, by the Pilots of the SMQ processes and every year in January at the Steering Committee.
Since the NFX certification, IMGT® has established Key Performance Indicators (KPI).
Scientific focus and quality of science are measured by the number of publications, participations to meetings, invitations, new external collaborations and new contracts. Community served by the resource is measured by the annual survey (fundamental research, clinicians, biotechnology, big pharma, etc), e-mail exchanges, number of academic collaborations, educational workshops (IG-CLL), networks (EuroClonality), participation to education abroad on antibody informatics (USTH Hanoi, Vietnam), permanent education (Biocampus), seminars delivered abroad (Helsinki, Finland).
 
Quality of service is measured by the SMQ indicators (e.g., response time to user messages, survey). Questionnaires to measure the users’ satisfactions and/or suggestions are being put in place on a regular basis (once per two years at least).
","As an example of the usage of the resource, we follow on a monthly basis the IMGT/HighV-QUEST. Specifically, in August 2018, 366 582 658 sequences were analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST.
Till date (August 30, 2018), more than 17.9 billion of sequences were analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST, by 2593 users from 46 countries (44% users from USA, 34% from EU, 22% from other parts of the world).

The aim of GnpIS is to facilitate the integration of genomic data (mostly genome annotations, polymorphisms and synteny), genetic data (QTLs, GWAS) and phenotypic data. It currently hosts mainly plant (crop and forest) data and some genomic data for plant pathogenic fungi. 
GnpIS hosts important public data sets such as for instance the INRA national catalogs of crop and forest trees genetic resources that feed the catalog of the French infrastructure of Resources for Research in Agriculture (www.agrobrc-rare.org) and all the genome data of the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC; https://wheat-urgi.versailles.inra.fr/). Data can be kept under restricted access in the frame of collaborative projects (national or international) before publication and GnpIS is the central repository of six large crop oriented national public-private projects gathering most of the french research forces of each of the targeted crops (ANR 2011-2020: AKER, BREEDWHEAT, AMAZING, PEAMUST, RAPSODYN, BFF). It is a major player for data management of the of the French national node of the ESFRI EMPHASIS for plant phenotyping and its staff has been very active in linking the ELIXIR and EMPHASIS European infrastructures (https://www.elixir-europe.org/use-cases/plant-sciences).
In the five last years, GnpIS has evolved to facilitate its insertion in open federations of databases for the plant community, with a strong role of the ELIXIR plant community and increased collaborations with ELIXIR’s platforms. The first operational proof of concept was achieved for the international community working on wheat in the frame of the Wheat initiative (http://wheatis.org/). This evolution towards federations of information systems is strongly supported by the activities of the URGI staff in national and international projects aiming at defining generic data models and data standards (Breeding API, Research Data Alliance, Wheat Initiative, FP7 TransPLANT, H2020 ELIXIR-EXCELERATE, IFB). URGI staff is involved in the steering committee of the MIAPPE standard (www.miappe.org) for plant phenotyping experiments, in the development of guidelines for data standardization for the wheat community (www.wheatis.org) that serves as model for other plant communities and is actively involved in the global Breeding API initiative (www.brapi.org). 
","Data
Interoperability
","GnpIS is the repository for the global community working on wheat genomics. 
GnpIS is INRA’s repository for crops and forest trees catalogs of genetic resources, their phenotyping data and genetic data, as no central archive exists for such data and to support their linkage with genomic data. 
Data and metadata are curated (i) to follow the state of art standards: MIAPPE (www.miappe.org) and Crop Ontology (www.cropontology.org) for phenotyping data, MultiCropPassportData for genetic resources, NCBI/EMBL recommendations for genomic data and (ii) to facilitate integration. Finally, GnpIS gives access to curated genome annotations, with a strong expertise of URGI’s staff on transposable element annotation.
","GnpIS stores and integrates genomic data (mostly genome annotations, polymorphisms and synteny), genetic data (QTLs, GWAS) and phenotypic data from INRA researchers and their national and international partners. It currently hosts mainly plant (crop and forest) data of all categories and genomic data (mainly genome annotations) for plant pathogenic fungi. Curated genome annotations or tools facilitating curation are provided to users. Finally, recently GnpIS has started to expose some of its data in with a semantic representation to improve data integration in other databases (https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/About-us/News/2017/RDF-Phenotyping).
It is open to the global wheat community and a dedicated file repository has been set up by URGI staff to facilitate standardized data deposition (https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/dspace/).
","Plant","2002","Mature","GnpIS application
GnpIS application can be distributed under a Cecill licence depots APP for GnpIS’s core SQL database and legacy interfaces. Its new search interface, based on APIs and noSQL layers are progressively developed under open access license BSD 3 and deposited on GitLab (https://forgemia.inra.fr/urgi-is/unified-interface).

Data integration in GnpIS
This service can be accessed by data producers by different means that are described in the web pages of the URGI plateform:
• https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Platform/Service-offering
• https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/gnpis/
And specific pages targeted to the wheat community:
• Wheat Initiative : http://wheatis.org/
• IWGSC : https://wheat-urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Seq-Repository

More generally:
•	Data integration for INRA patrimonial data (genetic resources, network of experiments in crops and forest trees, …) is free of charge: managed by direct interactions with the coordinators of the networks and the data integration service offer. 
•	Data integration for INRA units is free of charge (all type of data, less than 3 months of work) via https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Platform/Service-offering: Genomic, genetic resources, genetic map, QTL, polymorphism, phenotyping, GWAS …
o	Data integration partnerships in project consortia (ANR PIA, EU projects, international projects): URGI PF is a funded partner of the project. Exception: IWGSC and Wheat Initiative where data are integrated free of charge.
Note that URGI encourage users to associate DOI to the deposited datasets and help the data producers to get it with proper metadata in collaboration with INRA’s open data repository service (https://data.inra.fr/). It allows to discuss the license associated to data with a default proposition of CC-BY V4.0 for public data.


","GnpIS Application
The URGI unit and all its activities has been certified ISO-9001 version 2008 since 2012 and has been revising its process map to include “Provide Platform services” since 2016, which includes the services provided by GnpIS. The unit plans to get its new certification ISO9001 version 2015 by the end of 2018, early 2019. 
Since 2008, the application has been distributed to two private companies and one public laboratories.
Data browsing and retrievial
Access to data in GnpIS (https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/gnpis/) through a public web portal allowing to browse each data modules or by searching through all the data simultaneously using quick search ('google like search') or advanced search (Biomart, Galaxy, Intermine) tools. Authenticated access is required for private data (https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/General-Terms-of-Use). Additional free access to specific contents (e.g. wheat data, accessions managed by the French BRC) are provided to dedicated communities through specific portals (https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/wheatis/ ; https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/siregal/siregal/grc.do). Data provenance is documented in the database but we increasingly associate DOI to data sets and recommend data papers to our users as an improvement of this documentation.
Data are retrieved in standard formats:
•	Genetic resources: accessions and their passport data can be retrieved as a MultiCrop Passport Data standard compliant .csv format via GnpIS web interface or computationally through a BrAPI compliant web service.
•	Phenotyping data can be retrieved as a MIAPPE compliant Isa-tab format or computationally through a BrAPI compliant web service.
•	Polymorphism data can be retrieved as a .vcf and .csv format via GnpIS interface
•	Genome annotation data can be retrieved as a gff3 format via web pages dedicated to the species when GnpIS is the official repository or in international archive as described in the metadata of the GnpIS JBrowses.
•	Genetic data can be retrieved in a .csv format as there is no internationally agreed standard.

I include here the abstract of the recent (Jan 2018) journal paper describing the resource (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2017.10.012): 

Many vocabularies and ontologies are produced to represent and annotate agronomic data. However, those ontologies are spread out, in different formats, of different size, with different structures and from overlapping domains. Therefore, there is need for a common platform to receive and host them, align them, and enabling their use in agro-informatics applications. By reusing the National Center for Biomedical Ontologies (NCBO) BioPortal technology, we have designed AgroPortal, an ontology repository for the agronomy domain. The AgroPortal project re-uses the biomedical domain’s semantic tools and insights to serve agronomy, but also food, plant, and biodiversity sciences. We offer a portal that features ontology hosting, search, versioning, visualization, comment, and recommendation; enables semantic annotation; stores and exploits ontology alignments; and enables interoperation with the semantic web. The AgroPortal specifically satisfies requirements of the agronomy community in terms of ontology formats (e.g., SKOS vocabularies and trait dictionaries) and supported features (offering detailed metadata and advanced annotation capabilities). In this paper, we present our platform’s content and features, including the additions to the original technology, as well as preliminary outputs of five driving agronomic use cases that participated in the design and orientation of the project to anchor it in the community. By building on the experience and existing technology acquired from the biomedical domain, we can present in AgroPortal a robust and feature-rich repository of great value for the agronomic domain.","Data

"SIFR BioPortal and Annotator","Clement Jonquet","LIRMM (Laboratory of Informatics, Robotics and Microelectronics of Montpellier)","University of Montpellier","161 rue Ada, 34090 Montpellier, France","jonquet@lirmm.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","The volume of data in biomedicine is constantly increasing. Despite a large adoption of English in science, a significant quantity of these data uses the French language. Biomedical data integration and semantic interoperability are necessary to enable new scientific discoveries that could be made by merging different available data. A key aspect to address those issues is the use of terminologies and ontologies to structure biomedical data and make them interoperable. The community has turned toward ontologies to design semantic indexes of data that leverage the medical knowledge for better information mining and retrieval. However, besides the existence of various English tools, there are considerably less ontologies available in French and there is a strong lack of related tools and services to exploit them. This lack does not match the huge amount of biomedical data produced in French, especially in the clinical world (e.g., electronic health records).

The Semantic Indexing of French Biomedical Data Resources (SIFR – http://www.lirmm.fr/sifr) project investigates the scientific and technical challenges in building ontology-based services to leverage biomedical ontologies and terminologies in indexing, mining and retrieval of French biomedical data. Our main goal is to enable straightforward use of ontologies freeing health researchers to deal with knowledge engineering issues and to concentrate on the biological and medical challenges; especially when exploiting ontologies for free text data. Indeed, researchers have called for the need of automated annotation methods and for leveraging natural language processing tools in the curation process. Still, even if the issue is being currently addressed for English, French is not in the same situation: there is little readily available technology (i.e.,“off-the-shelf” technology) that allows the use of ontologies uniformly in various annotation and curation pipelines with minimal effort.

Within SIFR, we have developed the SIFR BioPortal (http://bioportal.lirmm.fr), an open platform to host French biomedical ontologies and terminologies based on the technology developed by the NCBO. The portal facilitates use and fostering of terminologies and ontologies which were only developed in French or translated from English resources and are not well served in the English-focused NCBO BioPortal. As of mid-2018, the portal contains 28 public ontologies and terminologies (+ 6 private ones) that cover multiple areas of biomedicine, such as the French versions of standards terminologies (e.g., MeSH, MedDRA, ATC, ICD-10) but also multilingual ontologies such as Rare Human Disease Ontology, OntoPneumo or Ontology of Nuclear Toxicity. Ontologies have been offered by the CISMeF group from Rouen University Hospital, or taken from the UMLS, or directly uploaded by users. When ontologies are multilingual, we directly connect to the main NCBO BioPortal and only parse the French content –so users do not have to upload their multilingual ontologies twice. The SIFR BioPortal has been released in June 2015 and actively used and improved since then. 

The original motivation in building the SIFR BioPortal was to design an ontology-based indexing workflow and develop the SIFR Annotator (http://bioportal.lirmm.fr/annotator) to address the lack of out-of-the-shelve openly and easily accessible semantic annotation system for French. The service is originally based on the NCBO Annotator, a web service allowing scientists to utilize available biomedical ontologies for annotating their datasets automatically but was significantly enhanced and customized for French. The SIFR Annotator service processes raw textual descriptions, tags them with relevant biomedical ontology concepts and returns the annotations to the users in several formats such as JSON-LD, RDF or BRAT. In building the SIFR BioPortal and Annotator our vision was to embrace semantic web standards and promote openness and easy access.

","Data

Interoperability
","Yes the SIFR BioPortal is a deposition database and a knowledge base which embraces semantic web technologies.
The SIFR Annotator is a semantic annotation tool. 

Ontologies and terminologies in biomedicine are spread out over the Web, or not yet publicly available; they are represented in different formats, change often and frequently overlap. In building the SIFR BioPortal and Annotator our vision was to embrace semantic web standards and promote openness and easy access.
The SIFR BioPortal and Annotator go hand-by-hand with their English counter part, the NCBO BioPortal and Annotator: 
- we only focus on semantic resources with French content
- we have reconnected (mapping reconciliation) all the French terminologies in the SIFR BioPortal with their equivalent in the NCBO BioPortal (not trivial, see 
","French biomedical and clinical data provider and ontologists.

SIFR BioPortal has become the largest generic and open –with publicly access resources, code and related data– French-language biomedical ontology and terminology repository in France. More details for the SIFR BioPortal sources: 
●	Our first source of semantic resources is the UMLS Metathesaurus, which contains six French terminologies, translations of their English counterparts. 
●	Our second source of French terminologies is the CISMeF group, which in France is the most important actor to import and translate medical terminologies.
●	Our third source of ontologies is the NCBO BioPortal. Indeed, multilingual biomedical ontologies that contain French labels are generally uploaded to the NCBO BioPortal by their developers. We automatically pulled the ontology sources into the SIFR BioPortal and display/parse only the French content in our user interface and backend services (including the SIFR Annotator dictionary).
●	Finally, direct users or institutions are the last source of ontologies and terminologies in the SIFR BioPortal. The resources concerned are semantic resources developed only in French that are either not included in HeTOP or not offered by CISMeF. For instance, the Loterre project (www.loterre.fr) offers multiple health related SKOS vocabularies for which the SIFR BioPortal is another point of dissemination and automatic API access.

Examples for the SIFR Annotator:
We are currently developing several partnerships in France to use SIFR Annotator within hospitals (CHRU Nancy, George Pompidou European Hospital in Paris) or for large-scale annotation efforts (e.g., to annotate the corpus of course of the French national medicine curriculum in the SIDES 3.0 project).
","Human data (including Rare Diseases, Copy number Variations, Human cell Atlas)","2015","Mature","The key idea is to be web based, fully open access and open source. Other things were developed in France before (especially by CHU Rouen's CISMeF) but ARE NOT publicly accessible.

The SIFR Annotator is the first openly web accessible tool to annotate and contextualize French biomedical text with ontology concepts leveraging a dictionary currently made of 28 terminologies and ontologies and 333K concepts. The code is openly available, and we also provide a Docker packaging for easy local deployment to process sensitive (e.g., clinical) data in-house (https://github.com/sifrproject).","In a paper to be published (attached to this form but private) we show the SIFR Annotator web service performs comparably to other knowledge-based annotation approaches in recognizing entities in biomedical text and reach state-of-the-art levels in clinical context detection (negation, experiencer, temporality). ","The SIFR BioPortal currently hosts 28 French-language ontologies (+ two privates) and comes to complement the French ecosystem by offering an open, generic and semantic web compliant biomedical ontology and health terminology repository. We add a few resources a year. 
Our users are mainly the French semantic resources provider in the domain of health.
We are currently interacting with French ASIP agency for perenisation of the resource.

The SIFR Annotator is more for research project in biomedical and health applications. Potentially lots of data provider interested.

The service provided by URGI has been so far developed in the frame of several major projects of distributed infrastructures, to which it provides today data discoverability: 
•	the transPLANT European research infrastructure (http://www.transplantdb.eu/), 
•	the WheatIS international project (http://www.wheatis.org/), 
•	the information system of the French National Phenotyping Network, Phenome (https://www.phenome-fppn.fr/), which is the French node of the European Plant Phenotyping infrastructure, EMPHASIS (https://emphasis.plant-phenotyping.eu/), 
•	the portal of the French Biological Resource Centers for Agronomical Research, RARe (https://www.agrobrc-rare.org), 
•	and the ELIXIR portal of the plant community (https://www.elixir-europe.org/use-cases/plant-sciences) in collaboration with the interoperability and the compute platform. 
A pilot project developed a light Data Discovery tool based on text indexing technologies (Solr), which allows to find data across several distinct databases based on a common high level generic data model (Spannagl et al 2016). It has been implemented among several European plant databases and in the frame of the wheat initiative (WheatIS search). The current WheatIS search tool federates 16 databases from 7 countries (https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/wheatis/). It has been improved with the support of Elixir-fr/IFB in particular to enhance the search with semantic links between vocabularies and concepts (https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/ifb/). It is currently being upgraded with up to date technologies, improved code and packaging in the frame of the federation of catalogues for biological resources of the AgroBRC-Rare French national infrastructure (www.agrobrc-rare.org). This new version will be distributed publicly by the end of 2018 under an open source licence (https://forgemia.inra.fr/urgi-is/data-discovery). It will be used to upgrade the WheatIS portal.
Building on these first successful experiences, the ELIXIR plant community is developing a complementary integrated set of tools based on the Breeding API (BrAPI) exchange standard: the GnpIS Plant Data Search tool. BrAPI is an international standard web service API (Application Programming Interface) for plant breeding (https://www.brapi.org). Its use allows to add data interoperability to data discovery. GnpIS Plant Data Search consists in:
•	a system for harvesting and indexing data from BrAPI endpoints that has been developed and published on the Elixir Github (https://github.com/elixir-europe/plant-brapi-etl-data-lookup-gnpis). 
•	A first version of web interface that will be implemented in GnpIS in November (https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/gnpis-core/). 
The adoption of the system is growing fast starting from the Elixir Plant community with the implementation of 13 BrAPI endpoints that allowed to validate the harvester and to test the interface. Elixir-de also contributed to the library of federation enabling tools through the publication of BrAPI endpoint validation tool, BRAVA that is used to test the quality of the web services. It is important to note that these federation enabling tools are part of the formal discussions between ELIXIR and EMPHASIS ESFRIs (see https://www.elixir-europe.org/use-cases/plant-sciences).
The upgraded version of the generic Data Discovery tool and the BrAPI-based Plant Data Search tool will be integrated in a next step to provide plant portal(s) that allow the discovery of any data type and more detailed searches in some of them, based on BrAPI web services (genetic resources, phenotyping experiments in the first version).","Data
Tool
Interoperability
","The Data Discovery tool allows the discovery of any data type. Its current implementations supported by URGI are:
•	The WheatIS search that allows to search 16 important worldwide community databases for this species. New nodes are still regularly included in the federation with the support of URGI staff.
•	A Plant Data Discovery Portal has also been set up by extending the access of the nodes involved in the WheatIS federation to data on other plant species and by adding new nodes. It also upgrades the original portal developed in the transplant FP7 project by Spannagl et al 2016.
•	The AgroBRC search, which is currently under development.

The BrAPI-based GnpIS Plant Data Search tool will allow a detailed search on genetic resources and phenotyping experiments. The current level of implementation towards the final portal is as follows:
A harvester of BrAPI endpoints has been developed using the Python language. It feeds a centralized Elasticsearch index which is used as data store of the central GnpIS Plant Data Search engine that enables faceted data discovery among the whole BrAPI network.
A proof of concept is available (https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/gnpis-core-srv/swagger-ui.html), currently only with INRA data in its public version. Elixir partners’ data and the updated GnpIS Plant Data Search web interface maintained at URGI will be available in production by mid-2019.
","The objective of these tools are to facilitate the development of national and international federations of information systems. 
The Data Discovery tool is meant to be generic and to be adaptable to virtually any federation in the field of the life science. It currently serves the wheat international community but it is also becoming a tool at a more general level in the plant and forest communities. By the end of 2018, it will deliver a search tool for a federation of French national catalogs of biological resources in animals, crops and forest, microbes, soil metagenomes, insects, etc… It will be used for the same purpose at the EU level in a H2020 project starting beginning of 2019.
The GnpIS Plant Data Search tool relies on the BrAPI standard that enables deeper data interoperability between the information systems of a federation but is focused to the plant community. A proof of concept is under development in the frame of the ELIXIR plant community in collaboration with the EMPHASIS infrastructure. However, many information systems are currently implementing BrAPI restful API around the world and there is therefore a high potential of extension at a global level. Finally, it is planned to combine the generic capabilities of the Data Discovery Tool and the BrAPI enabled data interoperability, if not in the coming version of the plant portal, in the next one.","Plant","2016","Emerging","Data Discovery Tool
The current version of the data discovery tool is available on INRA GitLab (server side application: https://forgemia.inra.fr/urgi-is/wheatis-portal and client side application: https://forgemia.inra.fr/urgi-is/wheatis-portal-gwt) under the BSD3 license. The corresponding data store and ETL can be downloaded (https://wheat-urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Projects/Wheat-Information-System/Solr-tool-package or via the IFB portal: https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/fr/services/donnees). The upgraded version of the generic data discovery is available on GitLab (https://forgemia.inra.fr/urgi-is/data-discovery) and will be soon officially released.
URGI staff provides support to join the wheat and plant federations (https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Platform/Service-offering). 

GnpIS Plant Data Search
The data harvester is available on Elixir Github (https://github.com/elixir-europe/plant-brapi-etl-data-lookup-gnpis) under the BSD3 license and the GnpIS Plant Data Search central engine and interface will be published on INRA Gitlab and Elixir Github by mid 2019 under BSD3 license. 
Repositories wishing to join the Elixir Plant Federation need first to develop their own BrAPI endpoints. This is supported by URGI staff (https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Platform/Service-offering), Elixir Plant Community (https://www.elixir-europe.org/use-cases/plant-sciences), and the BrAPI initiative (https://brapi.org/index.php#about). All these structures or initiatives are collaborating to provide users help through tools and guidance, staff exchanges, specific sessions in workshops like Phenoharmonis or the Biohackathon, etc…","The codes of our tools are reviewed regularly for consistency and functionally tested. The Data Discovery tools is currently based on SolR and GWT technologies, while the GnpISPlant Data Search current version is based on Elasticsearch and GWT. The Data discovery tool upgrade will be based on Elasticsearch for the indexing and noSQL part of the software and Angular for the interface. It will provide continuous delivery through an automation of the unit and integration tests and of the deployments. The same approach and technologies will be applied to the final version of the GnpIS Plant Data Search Tool to be delivered by mid-2019. It will facilitate their integration in a single plant portal and high quality delivery of future improvements.

IMGT® is a high-quality integrated knowledge resource specialized in the sequences, genes and structures of immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies, T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility (MH) of human and other vertebrate species, in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), MH superfamily (MhSF) and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) of vertebrates and invertebrates, in the fusion proteins for immunological applications (FPIA) and composite proteins for clinical applications (CPCA).

IMGT® consists of 7 databases (IMGT/LIGM-DB, IMGT/GENE-DB, IMGT/3Dstructure-DB, etc) and 17 online interactive tools for the analysis of sequences (IMGT/V-QUEST and its high throughput version IMGT/HighV-QUEST for next generation sequencing (NGS), IMGT/DomainGapAlign for domain amino acid sequence analysis , etc.), and the analysis of genes and of three-dimensional (3D) structures. IMGT® also provides one standalone (IMGT/StatClonotype) and more than 20,000 pages of Web resources.

IMGT® resource is unique: there is no equivalent in the USA or elsewhere in the world. IMGT® provides the reference standards (nomenclature of the genes and alleles, description labels and  IMGT unique numbering of the domains, based on the IMGT Scientific chart rules and the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts, for a common access to standardized identification, classification, description and numerotation of the data (sequences, genes and structures) in immunogenetics and  immunoinformatics, whatever the species. IMGT® is in charge, since its creation in 1989, of the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) Nomenclature SubCommittee, IMGT-NC, for the nomenclature of the genes and alleles of the immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies and T cell receptors (TR) of all vertebrate species with jaws (gnasthostomata), from fish to human.

IMGT® works in close collaboration with EBI (Europe), DDBJ (Japan) and NCBI (USA). More specifically, IMGT® uses the same accession numbers for nucleotide sequences as ENA, GenBank and DDBJ. IMGT genes are officially approved by HUGO Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) since 1999 and used by NCBI Gene, Ensembl (Hinxton, UK), UniProt (all have direct links to IMGT/GENE-DB which is the international reference database for IG and TR genes).
At the international level, IMGT® is Academic Institutional Member of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) since 2006, Member of the Global Alliance for the Genomics and Health (GA4GH) since 2015. At the European level, IMGT® obtained funding from the EU programmes (BIOMED1, BIOTECH2, 5th PCRDT, 6th PCRDT, 7th PCRDT IST). At the national and regional level, IMGT® is labeled Bioinformatics Platform RIO (2001), IBiSA since 2007, Grand Plateau Technique for Research and Innovation Languedoc-Roussillon since 2005, Cancéropôle Grand Sud-Ouest, ReNaBi, GDR CNRS (BiM, ACCITH), Labex MabImprove.

IMGT® is certified ISO 9001 and NFX 50-900 since October 18, 2010 (standards ISO:2008:2015 and NFX 50-900:2016), approved for: ‘Research, development and provision of an integrated system (databases, tools and Web resources) in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics’.
","Data
Tool
","IMGT® is a knowledge resource with expert curation and added-value to the data provided in  seven databases (of sequences, genes and 3D structures) and in the IMGT reference directories associated to the tools (IMGT/HighV-QUEST, IMGT/DomainGapAlign, etc.). 
IMGT® tools are provided online to the scientific community to give access to everyone to analyze their data (nucleotide and amino acid sequences, genes and 3D structures of antigen receptors, immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies and T cell receptors, whatever the species from fish to human) using the IMGT standards (identification, description, numerotation) based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY concepts. All IMGT® databases and tools use the same genes and allele nomenclature, the same label description  and the same domain numbering whatever the data type (sequences, genes or 3D structures) and whatever the species.
","IMGT® databases (7) , interactive tools (17)  and Web resources. (more than 20,000 pages) in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics are used by researchers in academic and pharmaceutical laboratories in multiple areas of research:
- basic research,
- NGS repertoire analysis of antigen receptors (immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies, T cell receptorts (TR) 
- medical research (analysis of repertoires of antibody and T cell receptor recognition sites in normal (infections, cancers) and abnormal (autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies) immune responses and in proliferative syndromes (leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas)),
- veterinary research (study of the IG and TR repertoires in domestic and wild species),
- genomic research (study of the diversity and evolution of genes of the adaptive immune response),
- research in structural biology (evolution of IgSF and MhSF protein domains),
- biotechnology related projects of the Human Proteome Organisation (HUPO) 
- antibody engineering (single chain variable fragment scFv, Fab, combinatorial libraries, phage display) and antibody humanization (chimeric, humanized and human antibodies),
- diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic monitoring of leukemias, lymphomas and myelomas (identification of the malignant clone(s) and assessment of residual diseases),
- therapeutic approaches (grafts, immunotherapy, vaccinology).

","1989","Mature","•	Databases
Data provided by IMGT® come from academic sources and are publicly available. The seven IMGT databases are publicly available to academic users: IMGT/LIGM-DB (the IMGT® nucleotide database (179,249 sequences from 352 species in September 2018), IMGT/PRIMER-DB (the IMGT®primer database), IMGT/GENE-DB (the IMGT® gene database (5,556 genes and 7,548 alleles from 28 species, of which 717 genes and 1,507 alleles for Homo sapiens and 871 genes and 1,322 alleles for Mus musculus in September 2018), IMGT/2Dstructure-DB (for antibodies and other proteins for which the 3D structure is not available) and IMGT/3Dstructure-DB (for 3D structures, contact analysis and paratope/epitope interactions of IG/antigen and TR/peptide-MH complexes), IMGT/mAb-DB (interface for therapeutic antibodies and fusion proteins for immune applications (FPIA). IMGT/CLL-DB, requires a password as it is a working place for a consortium of clinicians and contains sequences from patients prior to submission to generalist databases (ENA, GenBank, DDBJ) and publications.

•	Standalone tools
IMGT/StatClonotype, the IMGT® tool distributed as a standalone, is incorporated in the R package 'IMGTStatClonotype' under the LGPL licence. ""The GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is corporate-friendly and quite often used in R librairies. It allows for usage of certain library but modifications to it should be made public.""

•	Online tools and web resources
The seventeen IMGT® online tools and the web resources (>20,000 pages) are freely accessible to academic users. IMGT interactive tools accessible from the IMGT® Home page comprise: IMGT/V-QUEST (analysis of rearranged nucleotide sequence) and its high-throughput version IMGT/HighV-QUEST (500,000 nucleotide sequences per batch), IMGT/JunctionAnalysis, IMGT/Allele-Align, IMGT/PhyloGene, IMGT/DomainDisplay (amino acid sequences), IMGT/LocusView, IMGT/GeneView, IMGT/GeneSearch, IMGT/CloneSearch, IMGT/GeneInfo, IMGT/GeneFrequency, IMGT/DomainGapAlign (for amino acid sequence analysis of IG and TR variable and constant domains, and of MH groove domains), IMGT/Collier-de-Perles (for domain graphical 2D representation), IMGT/DomainSuperimpose, IMGT/StructuralQuery (for 3D structures). A password is required from the IMGT/HighV-QUEST users as this portal requires important computational resources for which IMGT® needs to apply twice a year (GENCI). All the IMGT® reference directories are publicly available online.
","IMGT® uses the indicators of its Quality Management System. IMGT® has been approved by Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance France SAS to the Quality Management System Standards: ISO 9001:2008 since October, 18, 2010 and NFX 50-900 since October 13, 2014. ""Research, development and provision of an integrated system (databases, tools and Web resources in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics"". These indicators are analyzed regularly, by the Pilots of the SMQ processes and every year in January at the Steering Committee.
Since the NFX certification, IMGT® has established Key Performance Indicators (KPI).
according to ISO 9001:2015 and NFX 50-900:2016. 
Scientific focus and quality of science are measured by the number of publications, participations to meetings, invitations, new external collaborations and new contracts.

Community served by the resource is measured by the annual survey (fundamental research, clinicians, biotechnology, big pharma, etc), e-mail exchanges, number of academic collaborations, educational workshops (IG-CLL), networks (EuroClonality), participation to education abroad on antibody informatics (USTH Hanoi, Vietnam), permanent education (Biocampus), seminars delivered abroad (Helsinki, Finland).
 Quality of service is measured by the SMQ indicators (e.g., response time to user messages, survey). Questionnaires to measure the users’ satisfactions and/or suggestions are being put in place on a regular basis (once per two years at least).
","IMGT® has been available on the Web since July 1995. IMGT® provides the biologists, researchers and clinicians with an easy to use and friendly interface to the seven databases, seventeen tools and to the >20.000 Web pages of resources. We have evaluated an exceptional response with more than 200,000 work sessions a month, and visitors equally distributed between the European Union, the United States and the remaining world. 
Similarly to the generalist databases (ENA, UniProt, PDB); IMGT is very frequently used but not necessarily quoted in the references as it has become natural to use it. Practically all publications in immunogenetics of the IG and TR used nowadays the IMGT gene names and alleles (e.g., IGHV1-2*01, TRAV1-1*01) and finding a ‘C23’ or a ‘C104’ in the text is a clear indicator of the use of the IMGT numbering. The article ‘Immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor genes (TR): IMGT® and the birth and rise of immunoinformatics’. Front Immunol. 2014 Feb 05;5:22. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2014.00022. Open access. PMID: 24600447, on invitation of the Union of International Immunological Societies IUIS) has a total of 12,494 views (on Sept 25,2018) since its publication on Feb 05, 2014.  

An indicator of the usage of the IMGT resource, we have selected to follow  IMGT/HighV-QUEST, on a monthly basis. For example, in August 2018, 366 582 658 sequences were analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST.
IMGT/HighV-QUEST is the first web portal (and so far the only one) for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) repertoire analysis of the adaptive immune response (online since October 2010). It provides NGS immunoprofiles of IG and TR repertoires and identification of IMGT clonotypes and is a paradigm for standardized comparison of the IG and TR repertoire analysis (diversity and expression) in normal (vaccination) and pathological situations (infectious diseases, cancers). 
- More than 17,9 billions of sequences analyzed to date (August 30, 2018)
- 2593 users from 46 countries (44% from USA, 34% from EU, 22% from other parts of  the world)
- About 5.7 million hours of computational resources
- 255 terabytes of results generated.

Driever, Freiburg, Germany; Argenton, Padova, Italy; Becker, Sydney, Australia) an online infrastructure for the study of transgenic expression patterns and immunohistochemical staining patterns in the Zebrafish brain and their development over time. 
This online database of standardized Zebrafish neuroanatomy is aiming to promote the constantly growing field of neurobiology in Zebrafish as a marine vertebrate model. The developmental aspect of this atlas will be emphasized during its further development. While currently only young larvae are included into the data pool, older stages and other staining modalities will be added over time. 
Furthermore we are currently implementing a protocol for fluorescent in-situ hybridization, which will allow us also to display the DNA or RNA of a given protein and by this increasing the precision of the included data.
While there are other approaches for atlases for standardized zebrafish neuroanatomy (H. Burgess, NICHD, USA; F. Engert, Cambridge, USA), this project sets itself apart by the ease of access and navigation of the data as well as the high quality/resolution of the integrated image data and the future integration of the developmental development as fourth dimension. 
Some strong points of our implementation are: 
no installation at all is needed to work with the atlas 
all data sets are true 3D volumes, currently confocal microscopy but in the future potentially also alternative 3D methods
interactive visualization in 2D and 3D
labelfree spatial query - independent of earlier analysis (e.g. segmentation)
a given setup/search/collection can be stored/exported in the form of an URL.
standard file formats
all data sets can be directly downloaded for local analysis
extensible to 4D (3D+time)

","In the current state the database not a deposition database in the true sense of the word. However, as a ‘platforme scientifique’ the Tefor Core Facility can provide the service of generating and integrating data sets on demand.
We are actively collaborating with an international interest group on the development of a generally accepted segmentation of the larval brain, describing the different brain regions and their connectivity. As soon as we reach agreement with this interest group, a complete, space-filling segmentation of the larval brain will be added. In a starting collaboration with Thomas Mueller (University of Kansas) and local colleagues we are also currently working on the same approach for the juvenile and adult Zebrafish brain.The segmentation of the  intermediate developmental stages will be interpolated from the initial segmentations (7dpf, juvenile), yielding a coherent schematic representation of development of the Zebrafish brain.","Our approach of building atlases of standardized neuroanatomy has multiple, very different, user groups. On the side of the (neuro- or developmental) biology the audience reaches from the young student, who needs easy access to a reliable source for learning the anatomy of the zebrafish brain to the researcher or principal investigator who needs to find a transgenic line, which is expressing in a region or cell population of interest or who wants to correlate her findings with other patterns of staining (e.g. transmitters or monoamines) or cell states (proliferation state). Using the data within the atlas alone can yield interesting findings and generate new scientific hypothesis, which can be used for the development of further experiments.
On the more systemic/technical side our atlas system can be applied to any other morphology, which is consistent enough to yield consistent data sets. We are also willing and able to assist with the generation of other atlases using our system.

Its space-filling regionalization follows the ontology developed by the ‘Insect Brain Name Working Group’ (Ito et al. 2014) and by this allows direct correlation of findings within the atlas to other publications(Ito et al. 2014)
The integration of the Rubin-Gal4-collection (Jenett et al. 2012; Pfeiffer et al. 2008, 2010) facilitates the development of new hypothesis and design of new experiments using this data pool. The integration of other data sources (Dickson VT collection, JRC splitGal4 collection, JRC lexA collection) is in preparation. 
The direct connection of the individual database entries to external databases (JRC, Flybase, Bloomington Stock Center) simplifies the work with the integrated fly lines with respect to their genetics and availability.
Developing and deploying a statistical template (Arganda-Carreras et al. 2018) for the alignment of the individual specimens in combination with the use of the ‘advanced normalization toolkit’ (ANTs) (Avants et al. 2014) provides unprecedented precision of the spatial correlation across all specimens.","Data

","This database is currently not designed as a deposition database. However, for bigger collections of data we can facilitate integration on request. A prerequisite for integration is the co-labelling of all specimens with a consistent reference label, ideally nc82, which labels all pre-synapses and by this promotes a detail-rich staining pattern used for the alignment of the specimens into the common coordinate system.
","Since the Tefor Drosophila atlas is freely accessible online this database of standardized adult Drosophila brain anatomy caters to the international community of Drosophila neurobiologists. Since the anatomic ontology of the brain segmentation is based on the internationally accepted ‘Systematic Nomenclature for the Insect Brain’ (Ito et al 2014), this atlas can also help to promote comparative research in other insect species. Due to its advanced visualization features frutifly.tefor.net is well suited to accelerating the approach to insect neuroanatomy for students. Hosting 3550 standardized expression patterns of the Rubin Gal4 collection (Jenett et al. 2012) together with links to their genetics (Flybase) and provider (Bloomington Stock Center) this database offers a convenient way from learning insect neuroanatomy to designing new experiments.","Structural bioinformatics","2017","Mature","All Tefor atlases are freely accessible worldwide.

Over the last decades, several dozens of tools have been proposed to simulate logical models (although mostly limited to Boolean components) , but GINsim has clearly emerged as (one of) the most used or cited in the field. 
Beyond easing model encoding and annotation, GINsim combines a very unique set of functionalities, ranging from model reduction, to attractor computation, and circuit functionality analysis, which together enable the analysis of large cellular networks (encompassing up to a few hundreds of components to date).

Regarding the relationships with ELIXIR, GINsim enables the exploration of the dynamical properties of cellular subnetworks and pathways encoded in ELIXIR databases such as Reactome. GINsim further enables the export of logical models into SML qual format and thereby their storage in the BioModels database.

The three groups collaborating on GINsim development are particularly involved in the organisation of recurrent thematic workshops, of courses at master and PhD levels, as well as of immersal training (short internships), focusing on the use of GINsim and complementary tools.

Finally, tools such as GINsim can be seen as a mean to articulate ELIXIR infrastructure and the emerging infrastructure for Systems Biology.","Tool","GINsim (Gene Interaction Network simulation) is a computer tool for the modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory networks. Using its user-friendly graphical interface, users can specify a signed regulatory graph, define boolean or multivalued logical functions, and then simulate and analyse its qualitative dynamical behaviour. 

GINsim supports various import and export formats (in particular SBML qual)  to ease model exchanges between different modelling and analysis tools. 

The companion model repository provide access to various logical models published over the last decades (about 65 to date).

It enables the fully automated reconstruction of a phylogeny centered on an query DNA sequence (either SSU/LSU rDNA or housekeeping genes commonly used in taxonomic studies of procaryotes). It provides a graphical interface to display the phylogenetic trees, relevant informations and automated deductions that facilitate the decision built-up by the biologists. leBIBI-QBPP (Quick Bioinformatics Phylogeny of Procaryotes) use is straightforward: it only requires that a sequence (or a set of sequences) be pasted in a webpage, whereas leBIBI-PPF (Prokaryote Phylogeny Facility) allows the exploration of the phylogeny of a given set of sequences selected on taxonomic grounds. Aside these uses, the databases behind leBIBI (leBIBI-DB) are made available for uploading. 
Whilst microbial identification systems exists on the web, based on Blast searches or similar approaches, none provides an automated phylogenetic approach and the assistance to decision-making. The resource is used worldwide by health, environmental or industrial microbiology laboratories. It is a reference system used by health/food/environment protection agencies in Europa and the USA. There are around 35000 connections yearly.
leBIBI web tool has been constantly evolving since 2003. The next version to be released later this autumn will use databases based on the RNA-CENTRAL databank (rnacentral.org) instead of GenBank database. ","Data
Tool
Training
","The current version of leBIBI-DB is built from GenBank/RefSeq entries, with relevant information for phylogeny/taxonomy and identification (Type-strain status, validation of the denomination, verification of the nature of the sequence and of its global quality) being added. When no type-strain sequence is identified, it is replaced by a representative sequence (chosen through a K-mers sharing criterion). The representative sequence of a given procaryote genus can be designated in the same way.
The SSU rDNA databases have five “flavors”. (i) The “lax” database contains all bacterial and archaeal SSU rDNA sequences of GenBank except those for which no taxonomical information more specific than Bacteria or Archaea is reported. It is very comprehensive but contains a large amount of not fully identified sequences. The coverage of genovars is maximum in the “lax” database. (ii) The “stringent” database contains sequences that are identified at the species level with a valid name according to the bacterial nomenclature. It also contains sequences of type strains of newly described bacteria or archaea, with an indication that their names are under consideration for eventual validation. The “lax” and “stringent” databases contain a lot of identical sequences and are rather frequently affected by erroneous species identifications. (iii) The “TS-stringent” database contains only sequences for type strains (TS), so that newly described or non validly published species may be missing. This database is less susceptible to contamination by erroneous species identifications. (iv) The “superstringent” database is a subset of the former where only one or a very small number of sequences is retained for each species. Identification errors are almost absent here, but newly described species or non validly published species are mostly absent. (v) Lastly, the “genus-level” database is a subset of the “superstringent” database containing only one sequence for each genus: that of the genus type-species TS. 
The multiple taxonomic level-structure of leBIBI-DB enables to build a phylogeny at the “superstringent” level with a limited number of neighbours and then to increase the resolution by using a wide-coverage DB such as the “stringent” DB. This type of zoom effect is especially effective when using the PPF tool to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of a given group of procaryotes.
The next version is to be released in October 2018 and will be based on the RNA-CENTRAL/ENA databases.

(https://umr5558-bibiserv.univ-lyon1.fr/lebibi/lebibi.cgi) dedicated to the
determination of the phylogenetic position of Archaea/Bacteria.  It enables
the fully automated reconstruction of a phylogeny centered on an query DNA
sequence (either SSU/LSU rDNA or housekeeping genes commonly used in
taxonomic studies of procaryotes). It provides a graphical interface to
display the phylogenetic trees, relevant informations and automated
deductions that facilitate the decision built-up by the biologists.
leBIBI-QBPP (Quick Bioinformatics Phylogeny of Procaryotes) use is
straightforward: it only requires that a sequence (or a set of sequences) be
pasted in a webpage, whereas leBIBI-PPF (Prokaryote Phylogeny Facility)
allows the exploration of the phylogeny of a given set of sequences selected
on taxonomic grounds. Aside these uses, the databases behind leBIBI
(leBIBI-DB) are made available for uploading.
Whilst microbial identification systems exists on the web, based on Blast
searches or similar approaches, none provides an automated phylogenetic
approach and the assistance to decision-making. The resource is used
worldwide by health, environmental or industrial microbiology laboratories.
It is a reference system used by health/food/environment protection agencies
in Europa and the USA. There are around 35000 connections yearly.
leBIBI web tool has been constantly evolving since 2003. The next version to
be released later this autumn will use databases based on the RNA-CENTRAL
databank (rnacentral.org) instead of GenBank database.","Data
Tool
Training
","The current version of leBIBI-DB is built from GenBank/RefSeq entries, with
relevant information for phylogeny/taxonomy and identification (Type-strain
status, validation of the denomination, verification of the nature of the
sequence and of its global quality) being added. When no type-strain sequence
is identified, it is replaced by a representative sequence (chosen through a
K-mers sharing criterion). The representative sequence of a given procaryote
genus can be designated in the same way.
The SSU rDNA databases have five “flavors”. (i) The “lax” database
contains all bacterial and archaeal SSU rDNA sequences of GenBank except
those for which no taxonomical information more specific than Bacteria or
Archaea is reported. It is very comprehensive but contains a large amount of
not fully identified sequences. The coverage of genovars is maximum in the
“lax” database. (ii) The “stringent” database contains sequences that
are identified at the species level with a valid name according to the
bacterial nomenclature. It also contains sequences of type strains of newly
described bacteria or archaea, with an indication that their names are under
consideration for eventual validation. The “lax” and “stringent”
databases contain a lot of identical sequences and are rather frequently
affected by erroneous species identifications. (iii) The “TS-stringent”
database contains only sequences for type strains (TS), so that newly
described or non validly published species may be missing. This database is
less susceptible to contamination by erroneous species identifications. (iv)
The “superstringent” database is a subset of the former where only one or
a very small number of sequences is retained for each species. Identification
errors are almost absent here, but newly described species or non validly
published species are mostly absent. (v) Lastly, the “genus-level”
database is a subset of the “superstringent” database containing only one
sequence for each genus: that of the genus type-species TS.
The multiple taxonomic level-structure of leBIBI-DB enables to build a
phylogeny at the “superstringent” level with a limited number of
neighbours and then to increase the resolution by using a wide-coverage DB
such as the “stringent” DB. This type of zoom effect is especially
effective when using the PPF tool to investigate the phylogenetic
relationships of a given group of procaryotes.
The next version is to be released in October 2018 and will be based on the

"SulfAtlas: a database dedicated to the classification of sulfatases","MICHEL, Gurvan","UMR 8227 (CNRS - Sorbonne Université)","Station Biologique de Roscoff","Station Biologique de Roscoff, Place Georges Teissier, 29680, Roscoff","gurvan.michel@sb-roscoff.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","Sulfated biomolecules are widespread in Nature and highly diverse in chemical structure and biological function. Sulfatases catalyze the cleavage of sulfate groups from such molecules and are key enzymes in the biomedical field, in environmental processes and in biotechnology. However the annotation of new sulfatases in genomic data is particularly prone to errors. A classification system (inspired by the world-wide known CAZy database for carbohydrate active enzymes, http://www.cazy.org/), allowing a better prediction of substrate specificity and for setting the limit of annotations, was therefore urgently needed for sulfatases. To answer this issue the Marine Glycobiology group (UMR 8227, SBR), in collaboration with the bioinformatics platform ABIMS (FR 2424, SBR), has created a general database, SulfAtlas (http://abims.sb-roscoff.fr/sulfatlas/), to classify all available sulfatases based on sequence homology and composed of four families of sulfatases (Barbeyron et al, 2016, Plos One, 11:e0164846). The formylglycine-dependent sulfatases, which constitute the largest family (S1), are also divided by phylogenetic approach into 73 subfamilies, each subfamily corresponding to either a known specificity or to an uncharacterized substrate. SulfAtlas summarizes information about the different families of sulfatases. Within a family a web page displays the list of its subfamilies (when they exist) and the list of EC numbers. The family or subfamily page shows some descriptors and a table with all the UniProt accession numbers linked to the databases UniProt, ExplorEnz, PDB and NCBI taxonomy browser. Diverse services are also provided (e.g. keyword search, BlastP search, exportation of sequences, etc.). Upon publication, SulfAtlas contained 4,550 sequences. In September 2017 a major update occurred and SulfAtlas currently encompasses 35,090 sulfatases sequences.

There is currently no equivalent resource covering sulfatases and thus we have an undisputed international leadership in this field. In less than 2 years (date of publication: 17 October 2016), the SulfAtlas database has been cited 17 times, notably in important reviews (Grondin et al, 2017, J Bac; Wasmund et al, 2017, Env Microbiol Rep), in one article on a renowned database (Terappon et al, 2017, NAR) and in high-profile journals (Ficko-Blean et al, 2017, Nature Com; Hettle et al, 2018, Structure; Kappelmann et al, 2018, ISME J). It is thus a significant sign that our sulfatase classification system, supported by SulfAtlas, is being adopted by the international community.

Evolution strategy: We continue to develop SulfAtlas along three axes: (a) in the context of the ANR project Blue Enzymes, our LaBGeM colleagues (Genoscope) have developed HHM profiles for the 73 S1 subfamilies and for the S2-S4 families. Our ABIMS colleagues will develop a program using these HMMs to screen the monthly UNIPROT release and to undertake a regular, semi-automatic update of SulfAtlas. (b) our LaBGeM colleagues will implement the automatic search of SulfAtlas for new genomes in their genome annotation platform “Microscope”. (c) We’re currently working on a classification system for Sulfotransferases, which will added to a future V2 of SulfAtlas.
","Data
Tool
","SulfAtlas is a knowledge-based database which (i) helps to better annotate sulfatases in (meta)genomic data and notably to improve the prediction of substrate specificities; (ii) guides the experimental biologists to select target sulfatases which remain to be characterized in term of function and structure. The data contained in SulfAtlas is curated by experts, based on our phylogeny-based classification system but also on literature (I.e. update of the  newly biochemically and/or structurally characterized sulfatases).","SulfAtlas is focused on a class of enzymes (Sulfatases). But sulfatases are present in the three kingdoms of life (Eucaryotes, Bacteria and Archae) and act on highly diverse sulfated biomolecules, small molecules (e.g. plant secondary metabolites, human sulfated hormones) and polymers (e.g. human glycosaminoglycans; algal sulfated polysaccharides and polyphenols). SulfAtlas is thus useful in various biological fields (e.g. biomedical, microbiology, plant natural substances, marine biology), but also in biotechnology and enzyme-assisted chemistry. Altogether, the served community is broad and resolutely international.","Human data (including Rare Diseases, Copy number Variations, Human cell Atlas)

Their detection and annotation are considered essential, and must be undertaken in the frame of any genome sequencing project. With the improvement of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the number of sequenced genomes rapidly increases. Only a fully automated TE de novo annotation process is able to face the sequence data deluge. TEs annotation is nowadays considered as a major task in genome projects. It has generated increasing interest in developing new methods for its efficient computational detection, annotation, and analysis. 

We developed the REPET package to annotate repeats in eukaryote genomes (Quesneville et al., 2005; Flutre et al., 2011; Hoede et al., 2014; Quesneville et al., 2003), now at its release v2.5.

This on-line tool uses concepts and methods developed in cartography that revolutionized the way geographic maps are explored (Google maps and OpenStreetMaps for example). In Lifemap, the Tree of Life can be zoomed-in, from a level where all three domains of life are visible to the level of any given species. This exploration is extremely fast and smooth. The tool also allows fast retrieval of any species or clade and gives the possibility to search and visualize any path in the tree.

A large-public version of this tool (http://lifemap.univ-lyon1.fr/explore.html) is dedicated to a broad audience with the display of Wikipedia descriptions and pictures on all nodes and tips. This version exists for desktops, but also as Android and iOS Apps (on the respective stores, under the name Lifemap-Tree of Life), and has already been downloaded more than 65,000 times (score : 4.7/5 on Android play store). 
En “expert” versions of the tool, Lifemap NCBI (http://lifemap-ncbi.univ-lyon1.fr), proposes the complete NCBI taxonomy and gives many information of high relevance for education and research in the fields of Ecology, Evolutionary Biology and Genomics. It also allows accessing specific pages of the NCBI website directly from the tool, and visualizing some information on the tree directly : the number of genomes that have been fully sequenced or any subtree from a list of taxids (NCBI taxonomy identifiers) input by the user. This version of Lifemap is updated every week by re-downloading and re-analyzing automatically the complete NCBI taxonomy. The other way around, NCBI taxonomy provides direct links to Lifemap from the web pages of many species and clades.   
A last version, Lifemap-server, allows the exploration of user-input trees. It is provided as a virtual machine. It is the only tool that exists that allows the visualization of trees with million of tips in an interactive way. 
Note that another tool allowing the exploration of a Tree of Life by zooming exists: OneZoom. This project is however more dedicated to the large public, with emphasize on the conservation status of species, and the tree is not displaying polytomies (uncertainties).  

The high number of downloads of the Lifemap (~65000) and the high number of weekly visits (~1000) illustrate the broad adoption of Lifemap by both the large public and the community of researchers in Evolution.

Fast and user friendly identification of candidate horizontal gene transfers across the tree of life from any donor to any receptor species groups. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a process by which an organism integrates coding genetic material from another organism by means other than “vertical” inheritance from an ancestor. HGT has long been recognized as an important mechanism shaping both the genome and biology of prokaryotes (e.g. acquisition of antibiotic resistance). Although the impact of HGT in eukaryotes is probably lower, recent evidences suggest this mechanism can bring novelty in eukaryotic biology too (e.g. adaptation to parasitism) (Danchin et al. 2016). Furthermore, substantial proportions of the gene sets of several eukaryotic species (e.g. fungi or rotifers) have likely been acquired via HGT. These observations combined with the availability of more and more whole genomes across the tree of life have raised interest in methods able to rapidly and robustly detect HGT in large datasets.
Currently, Alienness allows to rapidly detect putative HGT at high-throughput, based on BLAST searches. 


Originality: 
Alienness computes alien index scores based on differences between the BLAST ranking and statistics of the best donor and receptor clades from a query organism (which can be the whole set of proteins coded by an organism). The main originality is to propose an easy to use web interface over a usually labor intensive and complex process which consist in retrieving and analyzing the taxonomic information associated to sequences in BLAST libraries. This task is fully automated and transparent to the user. The user only needs to provide the BLAST results and set only 3 parameters to fine tune the program according to the needs. Then alien index scores are calculated automatically and provided to the user in the form of tables together with information on the putative donor of the transfer.

Strategy of evolution: 
We are planning to integrate other scoring methods in Alienness such as the HGT index (based on the BLAST scores vs. E-values for Alien Index) and we also plan to improve the specificity and sensitivity by calculating scores based on the n better donor and n better receptor statistics rather than simply the best ones.
We are also working on an evolution of this tool,  Alienness vs. Predictor (AvP), that performs automatic phylogenies and searches for tree topologies supporting HGT from Alienness candidates. Indeed, the gold standard methodology to verify the validity of a candidate horizontal transfer is phylogenetic analysis. The principle is to build a phylogenetic trees of the genes and compare the obtained topology to the expected reference species tree. By identifying inconsistencies between the gene and species trees, it is possible to identify topologies supporting an HGT event. This is exactly what the Predictor component of AvP performs. 

Evidence of community outreach and adoption;
The Alien Index method has first been proposed in 2008 in a paper published in Science on partial genome data of the bdelloid rotifer and was then re-used by the same authors in a paper published in Nature in the whole genome of this same species. Because the method was tricky to use it was not immediately popularized. Now that we have wrapped the method in a user friendly interface (Alienness) it has already been used for a dozen of projects before the publication of the Alienness (2017) paper and after. Some of the related projects have already been published including in high-profile journals such as Genome Biology. 

Positioning regarding other similar resources
To our knowledge there is currently no user-friendly resource that exist to calculate Alien Index scores at a high throughput and this allow to rapidly detect HGT across the tree of life. Some methods implementing calculation of Alien Index scores exist but they need to be installed locally and require expert skills in computational biology. The Alienness online tool is freely accessible to any biologist and does not require any particular skills in bioinformatics.","Tool

","Alienness (Rancurel et al. Gene 2017) is a taxonomy-aware web application that parses BLAST results against public libraries to rapidly identify candidate HGT in a genome of interest. Alienness takes as input the result of a BLAST of a whole proteome of interest against any NCBI protein library. The user defines recipient (e.g. metazoan) and donor (e.g. bacteria, fungi) branches of interest in the NCBI taxonomy. Based on the best blast E-values of candidate donor and recipient taxa, Alienness calculates an Alien Index (AI) for each query protein. Our method uses the Alien Index metrics as described in (Gladyshev et al, Science, 2008) to detect a significant gap of magnitude in E-values between candidate donor and recipient taxa. An AI >0 indicates a better hit to candidate donor than recipient taxa and a possible HGT. Higher AI represents a higher gap of E-values between candidate donor and recipient and a more likely HGT. The Alienness tool presents a fast and interesting method to rapidly identify candidate HGT and narrow down the number of genes to be analyzed afterwards.","Alienness is an international resource, freely accessible to everyone wishing to detect horizontal gene transfers.

Since bio image analysts focus on applied problems, this information is often inadequate. To overcome this issue, the platform BISE developed by the Network of European Bio-image Analyst NEUBIAS  try to match the problem with the relevant tools.
Learning from the success of community-based projects (e.g. Wikipedia) to achieve this goal, a crowdsourcing technique fostering exchanges and collaboration is applied to incrementally update the platform.
BISE seeks to provide a unification of views: problem-based (e.g. “find nuclei in cells”), method-based (e.g. “active contour based segmentation”) and tool-based (e.g. “CellProfiler”).  The platform will also gather commented links on articles describing algorithms with high potential but without a usable source code “Calls for implementation” to plan collaborative implementation through threads in the forum. The database is  edited in a manner similar to Wikipedia: i.e. the community provides content that is managed by curators. Crowd-sourced database editing is reinforced by strategic meetings called taggathons, boosting the content of the database. These meetings are also aimed at reaching consensus on future directions.
By sharing knowledge between the different communities, we aim to help biologists to find any tool or workflow available for a particular image analysis problem and to find the adequate image processing wording, but also to help software and algorithm developers to find missing tools (or components), and to help bioimage analyst to identify and edit workflows (linked components). It also aims to be a simple way to diffuse bio image analysis solutions, even when they cannot lead to a publication per se.
It represents a unique repository of image processing and analysis tools and workflows for and by the bioimaging community . It is the first large community effort to bridge algorithm and software developer, bioimage analyst and biologist communities , under the form of a web tool built by and for the community of  bioimage analysis and developers experts. It contributes to the open science cloud by folling the FAIR principle: data exposition following the bioschemas vocabularies, it is interoperable with other registry such as bio.tools or Plant Image Analysis, it is based on standrad ontologies (EDAM bioimaging) with a documentation of ontologies used. We can provide a machine readable dataset of the whole BISE crowd sourced content, and we provide a querying API with sample running SPARQL queries).  It is based on a live and continuous curation, allowing up to date review of existing software tools.
The community targeted are the developers (allowing them an easy way to diffuse their work or identify needs), the biologists (to find the right tools to tackle their bio image analysis problem), an the bio image analyst (to help them to compose a full workflow based on existing implemented bricks rather than reinventing the wheel) . In addition it can serve as a documented database of image analysis tools for stake holders such as journal editors, host intitutions for reports, teaching, creating sofwtare management plan.. It is of great interest for the european infrastructure Eurobioimaging which collaborate on this topic, as well as for Elixir who provides human ressources for extending the related ontologies.","Tool

","This database is a knowledge base which added value is the expert curation. It is curated through mainly two mechanisms: organization of ""taggathon"" (at least twice a year) to boost the content and discuss the developments, and by a continuous curation of the tool descriptions, with different level of expertise (such as Newbie Tagger or Confirmed taggers, with different rights on the database). For now, about 1203 software tools in the field of bioimage analysis are referenced.
It is organized in 3 main categories: Component (elementary bricks to be assembled to construct a workflow of analysis), Collection, i.e library of components, and workflows, linking as steps different components to answer one specific biological question.
","In October 2018, the website exposing the database biii.eu has received since its opening 6745 visitors.
The community served is international and is composed by:
- sofwtare developpers: to diffuse their tools, get an overview, select the right diffusion channel picking the right software platform/language, find where there is needs
- biologist: to find the right image processing wording for their biological question, get list of existing tools, discover what is possible to do automatically, to find  the right people to contact for collaborations/questions.
- bio image analyst (image data scientists) : to fill the gap between a technical/methods paper and its implementation (complements the information from the method paper), get standardized and quality information about the tools, find out what the needs of the biologists are (from comments and feedback left by those); diffuse his/her own unpublished tools/workflows;  to be pointed to biologists to when they ask for help","Human data (including Rare Diseases, Copy number Variations, Human cell Atlas)

"RINspector","Dr Marc Lensink","UGSF - UMR8576","CNRS","Parc de la haute-borne - 50 avenue de Halley - BP 70478 - 59658 Villeneuve d’Ascq Cédex France","marc.lensink@univ-lille.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","RINspector is an app for the Cytoscape network visualisation and analysis software, that calculates centralities on a Residue Interaction Network and predicts flexibility of proteins with Dynamine. It is available and documented on the Cytoscape app store (https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/rinspector).
Residue Interaction Networks are networks generated from a PDB structure where nodes are amino acids or small molecules and edges are interactions detected in the structure between them. They can be generated from a PDB structure with tools like RING2 (http://protein.bio.unipd.it/ring/), RINerator (https://rinalyzer.de/rinerator.php), Chimera2 (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/) + structureViz2 (https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/structureviz2), or any tool that analyzes interatomic distances. StructureViz2 is an app for Cytoscape that allows the user to directly generate a RIN into Cytoscape from a PDB structure opened in Chimera. Once a RIN has been loaded into Cytoscape, our app RINspector can be used to calculate centralities, and/or predict flexibility of a protein through a call to the DynaMine web server. Several centrality analyses are available: at the moment Residue Centrality Analysis (RCA), Betweenness Centrality Analysis (BCA) and Closeness Centrality Analysis (CCA). The DynaMine prediction only requires the chain for which to generate the prediction. A centrality analysis produces a Z-score per residue while a DynaMine prediction produces a S² order parameter per residue of the structure (or node of the network). 
Transforming a structure into a network allows to perform different types of analyses complementary to those that can be run on the structure directly. Centrality analyses allows to identify key residues for the function, folding or allostery of a protein. 
The advantage of integrating these calculations and predictions into Cytoscape is to make it accessible to people who work in the network field, with Cytoscape being widely used by biological network analysts. Besides RINspector, another app permits to perform centrality analyses, namely RINalyzer, but the two offer complementary functionalities. In particular, RINspector implements a centrality calculation called Residue Centrality Analysis, and retrieves flexibility predictions from the DynaMine server, using the sequence in amino acids of the Residue Interaction Network. RINalyzer permits to layout a network in function of position of amino acids in the corresponding structure. RINspector is an original tool and we are not aware of any equivalent software in other resources, including ELIXIR nodes and platforms.
RINspector was published in 2017 (Brysbaert et al, Bioinformatics, 2017). We improved it recently to enable (and document) automation of the tool functions that can be called from an external language like R or Python (Brysbaert et al, F1000research, 2018). We wrote a protocol that was submited recently for publication to Current Protocols in Bioinformatics and a tutorial is already accessible through the Cytoscape apps store. It has been used in different projects with collaborators or by other researchers and cited five times until now. For instance, we recently published an article that shows the effect on centrality analyses when considering water molecules in RINs (Brybaert et al, Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences, 2018). We plan to integrate additional information in RINs with RINspector (analyses, predictions, conservations...) in following versions of the tool.
The app was also presented during a talk and poster presentations to several conferences including a regional workshop about biological networks, JOBIM and ECCB. We actively collaborate with DynaMine developers, especially Dr Wim Vranken from ULB to discuss new analyses and predictions we could provide through RINspector.

Cytoscape can be directly downloaded from its website (http://www.cytoscape.org/) and requires Java 1.8 minimim for its current 3.6.1 version. Once installed and started, an app manager permits to freely download any app from the Cytoscape app store, including RINspector. It is distributed under a CeCILL licence (http://www.cecill.info/). The source code is open and available on the SourceSup platform (https://sourcesup.renater.fr/scm/?group_id=3888).","The app is available on the Cytoscape apps store and can be downloaded by anybody who installed Cytoscape 3.6 (or higher release). The RINspector page of the apps store provides documentation, links to publications and tutorial (https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/rinspector). It also shows how many times the app was downloaded (around 900 times at the end of September).
The app was updated in January last time and a release history is accessible on the app webpage. The source code is available on a SourceSup GIT repository (https://sourcesup.renater.fr/scm/?group_id=3888). As soon as new functionalities are implemented, the code is updated on the GIT repository and the app updated on the app store. An help page with general information and a mail address for bug reporting (cytoscape-rinspector@univ-lille1.fr) is viewable from the app menu. Help and support can also be requested through the cytoscape help desk (https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/cytoscape-helpdesk). Guillaume Brysbaert in particular, permanent CNRS research engineer of the team who participated to the development of the tool, provides support for the app.
Centrality analyses are calculated on the user’s computer while protein flexibility predictions are retrieved from the DynaMine server. Running times of centrality analyses depend on the size of the network but they usually last between a few seconds and a few minutes for Residue Centrality Analysis, and a few seconds for Betweenness Centrality Analysis and Closeness Centrality Analysis. A request to the DynaMine flexibility prediction server runs within a few seconds.
","Five publications currently cite the article including one from researchers with whom we don’t have any contact. The app was released one year ago and we often use it in the team for internal projects and collaborative ones that involve structural studies for the identification of candidates for mutageneses experiments. We are also running developments to calculate a score for protein-protein docking predictions based on centrality analyses.","5","4","de Ruyck J, Brysbaert G, Villeret V, Aumercier M, Lensink MF.

This tool is opinionated as it is focused on production and designed for bioinformaticians, its only user interface is the command line.

The experimental design of an analysis performed by Eoulsan is stored in a text file, while the parameters and the workflow steps are listed in a XML file. These two files ensure flexibility and traceability of the analyses performed. This approach allows to swiftly resume large analyses upon trouble-shooting, and guarantees reproducibility. We have been able to develop Eoulsan for RNA-Seq, Nanopore RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and scRNA-seq workflows.

Unlike its competitors, Eoulsan can work on a large set of infrastructures (personal workstation, server, cluster and Hadoop cluster). Eoulsan supports most of the job scheduling software (HT-Condor, TGCC, TORQUE, SLURM) to distribute user’s computations. Moreover the installation of Eoulsan is very easy as users just have to untar the latest archive of the tool. The only requirements of Eoulsan are a GNU/Linux distribution and Java.

To ease the development of new features and modules, Eoulsan reuses the syntax of the XML Galaxy tool description files. Simple Galaxy tools can work under Eoulsan without any modification. 
To go further in reproducility of the analyses, Eoulsan promotes Docker images to deploy software required by Eoulsan modules.

We plan to increase the number of available modules to support a larger panel of HTS analyses. We also want to include singularity containerization software in addition to Docker to bring easy module deployment on cluster infrastructures. Finally, we want to make HTS analyses with Eoulsan a better streamlined experience for bioinformaticians.

Eoulsan is used to perform expensive analyses and we need to be sure of the quality of the results. Moreover, as many people have contributed to the project since its beginning, we need to avoid code conflicts. That’s why we deployed unit and functional tests for this project.

When compiling Eoulsan, more than 500 unit tests are performed. These unit tests check all the Eoulsan API that handle biological data (e.g. the Java HTSeq-count reimplementation is validated using unit tests).

In addition to unit tests, we have developed a functional test framework that ensure we always obtain the same analysis results with new versions of Eoulsan on the same data. Today 190 functional tests are executed in 45 hours before validating each new version.

"ToulligQC","Laurent Jourdren","Genomic Core facility","IBENS","46 rue d’Ulm 75005 Paris	","jourdren@biologie.ens.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","ToulligQC is a quality control tool dedicated to Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencers.
At the time we started developing ToulligQC, ONT sequencing was an emerging sequencing technique and a very few tools were dedicated to take into account such data. We wanted to have a tool such as FastQC adapted to long-reads to decipher our run data and make a quick evaluation of its quality. We developed ToulligQC to suit the needs of a genomic core facility but it can easily be used in any laboratory.

As FastQC, it produces a QC report containing diagrams and tables useful to trace the quality and the amount of data produced during an ONT run.
When it was developed, most of the existing tools were executing very slowly and were neither adapted to RNA-Sequencing (a lot of shorter sequences compared to DNA-Sequencing), nor to handle a mix of barcoded samples in a single run. These three points were among the specifications of development of ToulligQC.
To be used in a production background, ToulligQC has to analyse a run data within a short amount of time. To do so, it retrieves the run data (number, length and quality for each read) and metadata (library protocols, flowcell and basecaller version…) from a very limited number of files: a run summary text file from the basecalling software and a FAST5 file.
If speed cannot be considered as its main advantage compared to other tools anymore, management of RNA-Seq and barcoded samples are still two points that are especially good in ToulligQC:
-	The diagrams are scaled for RNA sequences that are much smaller than DNA sequences.
-	A design file describing the samples and their barcodes allows us to define precisely our expectations, the diagrams and statistics are not achieve without purpose on barcodes that are not supposed to be used.
It was thought to fulfill our needs in RNA-Seq but it will perfectly handle data from DNA-Seq runs.

ONT sequencing is a fast evolving technology, it has not golden standard tool we can rely on. For these reasons, ToulligQC was developed in Python, an easy access language, especially dedicated to data analysis through its statistical, data handling and graphical packages.
To cope with the ONT protocol and algorithm evolution, ToulligQC and its documentation are on-going developments but they are stable enough to be currently used in our production pipeline. For this reason, ToulligQC is a tool that is meant to be maintained over the coming years.

To ease its deployment, it can be installed through a Docker image since September 2017 or through a PyPI package since December 2017. ToulligQC Docker image was pulled 116 times and its PyPI package has already been downloaded more than 3600 times what makes us confident about its usefulness. An application note about ToulligQC is about to be submitted. It will soon be available on BioRChiv.

","Tool","ToulligQC is dedicated to ONT sequencing quality check. It retrieves the run data (number, length and quality for each read) and metadata (library protocols, flowcell and basecaller version…) from two files: a run summary text file from the ONT basecalling software and a fast5 file. A homemade design text file describing the samples and their barcodes to be taken into account allows the precise definition of the diagrams and statistics that will be reported.
The data and QC diagram are summarized in an HTML report.
","ToulligQC is a freely available tool. It is dedicated to long-reads specifically produced by ONT sequencing. It can deal with RNA and DNA sequencing. It can handle barcoded samples.
It was developed for a genomics core facility but it can be use without any restriction in a research laboratory owning an ONT sequencer. It can serve the whole Oxford Nanopore Technology user community.

"AgroLD"," LARMANDE Pierre ","DIADE","IRD","911 avenue Agropolis, BP 6450134394 Montpellier cedex 5 - FRANCE","pierre.larmande@ird.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","We have developed the Agronomic Linked Data (AgroLD – www.agrold.org), a knowledge-based system relying on Semantic Web technologies and exploiting standard domain ontologies, to integrate data about plant species of high interest for the plant science community e.g., rice, wheat, arabidopsis. The aim of our effort is to provide a portal (to discover) and an endpoint (to query) for integrated agronomic information and to aid domain experts in answering relevant biological questions. The conceptual framework for the knowledge in AgroLD is based on well-established ontologies. The current phase (phase I) covers information on genes, proteins, ontology associations, homology predictions, metabolic pathways, plant traits, and germplasm, relevant to the selected species. At this stage, AgroLD contains around 100 million RDF triples created by converting more than 50 datasets from 10 data sources such as ensembl.plants or resources from South Green and INRA URGI bioinformatic platforms .The selection of these data sources was considered based on popularity among domain experts.
 - The originality of AgroLD comes from the data provided by the French bioinformatics agronomic laboratories combined with their exposure as RDF following the FAIR data principles. Furthermore, AgroLD publish the data through various user-friendly interfaces. 

- Regarding similar resources, the content of AgroLD is very close to Ensembl plant (https://plants.ensembl.org/index.html) for the gene annotation level but with less species covered. However they do not provide an integrative approach with others data types (e.g. expression data, pathways, ..) nor semantic web view of their data. The EBI RDF platform provides such capacity however it is dedicated to vertebrate species. Finally AgroLD is close to the Gramene (www.gramene.org ) U.S resource by using some of its data to transform in RDF. 
- AgroLD have possible links with Elixir Excelerate WP7 and the e-infrastructure e-rosa ( http://www.erosa.aginfra.eu/ ).","Data
Interoperability
","AgroLD is a knowledge base using semantic web technologies and exploiting standard domain ontologies, to integrate data about plant species of high interest for the plant science community. Each dataset was downloaded from curated sources and was annotated with ontology terms URIs by reusing the ontology fields when provided by the original source. In that case, we produced additional annotation with the corresponding ontologies thus adding 22% additional triples validated manually. Additionally, we used the AgroPortal web service API (http://data.agroportal.lirmm.fr/documentation) to annotate datasets with other vocabularies. ","Communities of users are mostly coming from plant molecular biology and plant breeding fields. The impact of AgroLD is expected to grow with an increase in coverage (with respect to the species and the data sources) and user inputs. AgroLD is recognized in several communities from local such as the South Green platform and laboratories of Montpellier, national with the INRA URGI, to international AgInfra (EU) and CRP RICE (CGIAR www.cgiar.org). The AgroLD platform targets these communities focusing at the beginning mostly on worldwide tropical crops (such as rice, banana, coffee) and targeting biological objects such as genes, proteins, pathways, biological traits with the aim of providing tools to analyse genome wide association studies (GWAS), and understanding the link between genotype and phenotype on a global genomic scale (i.e functional genomics).
","Plant","2016","Emerging","The service is freely available without any restriction. Users can access the service and use it without any login. However, the platform proposes registration accounts in order to keep track and save search and results done by users.

","i. AgroLD relies on the RDF and SPARQL technologies for information modelling and retrieval. The conceptual framework for the knowledge in AgroLD is based on well-established ontologies: GO, SO, PO, Plant Trait Ontology (TO) and Plant Environment Ontology (EO). We use OpenLink Virtuoso (version 7.2) to store and access the RDF graphs. Additionally, we developed a website (web pages) and an API to access the data.   The entities in the RDF graphs are linked by shared common URIs. As a design principle, we have used URI schemes made available by the sources (e.g., UniprotKB) or by Identifiers.org registry. For instances, proteins from UnitProtKB are identified by the base URI: http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/; genes incorporated from Gramene/Ensembl plants are identified by the base URI: http://identifiers.org/ensembl.plant/.

It is a fairly lightweight, web-based, platform-independent solution that may be deployed on a workstation or as a data portal. It allows to feed a MongoDB database with VCF, PLINK or HapMap files containing up to billions of genotypes, and provides a user-friendly interface to filter data in real time. Gigwa provides the means to export filtered data into several popular formats and features connectivity not only with online genomic tools, but also with standalone software such as FlapJack or IGV. Additionnally, Gigwa-hosted datasets are interoperable via two standard REST APIs: GA4GH and BrAPI.

The strengths of this tool are essentially :
    • its ease of use thanks to its GUI (unlike VCFtools)
    • its support for large data volumes (up to tens of billions of genotypes with suitable hardware)
    • the number of import and export formats it supports (not limited to the VCF format, unlike VCF-miner, VCF-filter, BrowseVCF)
    • the fact that it is an online application with user management, thus providing means to expose and share data

Interoperability
","Gigwa is not a reference database nor a knowledge base, it is a tool that may be used as a container for institutes willing to put their genotyping data online. At the same time, it allows users to filter this data online. It is interoperable with various online systems (GBrowse, JBrowse, Galaxy…) or standalone applications (IGV, Flapjack), and virtually with any application featuring client code for the BrAPI and GA4GH REST APIs. 
","It can prove useful to anyone working with large amounts of genotyping data, no matter which species he/she is specialized in (all levels of ploidy are supported). It was mainly developed based on the needs of researchers focusing on crop improvement, but is also used for exploring variation data obtained from animals or pathogen fungi for instance, and can surely serve the needs of health scientists aswell.

    • Two sessions were conducted by CIRAD towards private companies, within the scope of more general training initiatives : one in Bogor, Indonesia in july 2017, the other in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in november 2017. The goal was, for given phenotypes, to identify potentially causal SNPs near or within candidate genes, by narrowing them down using Gigwa filters
    • In august 2018, IRD staff was received at IRRI (Los Baños, Philippines) to provide assistance to local scientists in deploying Gigwa on AWS, and train them in administrating it
    • In october 2018, members of the South Green Platform will give a training in CERAAS (Thiès, Senegal) during which Gigwa will be introduced to biologists as a way of refining the contents of VCF files generated by NGS","An article describing the first version of Gigwa was published in 2016. Although local collaborators rapidly adopted the tool, it took time before other scientists showed interest. The advent of version 2 (a great improvement in terms of user-friendliness, robustness, functionalities, and interoperability, soon to be submitted for publication) is currently helping Gigwa to gain in popularity and we have thus been assisting foreign institutes in setting up instances for their own use :
    • CIAT setup the application to spread bean and cassava genotyping data ;
    • In the scope of the CRP Rice project, IRRI is using it as a flexible, intermediate solution for managing newly acquired genotyping data before migrating the final version of this data into SnpSeek.

As such, we are involved in the international Quest for Orthologs consortium which aims at standardize and benchmark orthology prediction tools. In this context, OrthoInspector was shown to be one of the most balanced methods of orthology inference in terms of precision and recall (Altenhoff et al., Nature Methods, 2016). 

The OrthoInspector database is updated regularly and the latest version (3.0) provides orthology and inparalogy inferences for 23,093,193 proteins from 4,753 complete Reference proteomes from UniProtKB selected according to quality criteria. It makes our database the most exhaustive orthology resource to date in terms of cellular species coverage. For instance, the ELIXIR orthology resources HOGENOM, OMA and OrthoDB include 1470, 2103 and 4667 proteomes respectively. OrthoInspector is also unique in providing multi-level predictions: fine-grained orthology relationships among an extended set of species within each domain (711 Eukaryotes, 3,863 Bacteria and 179 Archaea) and coarse-grained inter-domain relationships among a selection of 317 model species. These model species have been manually selected by experts to include high quality proteomes and well-studied species and also to ensure a good phylogenetic sampling of the three Life domains.

The OrthoInspector toolbox includes original visualization and exploration tools, giving users easy and rapid access to powerful comparative genomics analyses. Users can visualize the phylogenetic distribution of their proteins through a heatmap synthetic view and retrieve protein with similar distribution, which is a unique feature of OrthoInspector. A phylogenetic profiling tool allows to retrieve all the proteins of a species sharing a given distribution and to analyse their role through functional enrichment analysis. OrthoMCL and HOGENOM also offer a phylogenetic pattern search but through a basic user interface in a limited number of species (150 and 1470 respectively). In addition, OrthoInspector is the sole resource allowing to study the evolutionary histories of genes related to a given Gene Ontology term.  

OrthoInspector is registered in the IFB catalog of tools. OrthoInspector entries provide direct links to ELIXIR nodes resources: UniprotKB, Gene Ontology and InterPro. 

We plan to improve OrthoInspector visibility and accessibility in a near future. A cross-reference to OrthoInspector will be added in UniprotKB entries (Phylogenomic section); a mapping procedure is currently studied. Moreover, FAIRification of part of the OrthoInspector resource is planned.  ","Data
Tool
","OrthoInspector provides two main resources. First, the orthology and inparalogy database is a knowledge base containing functional and evolutionary information for 4,753 Reference proteomes from UniProtKB. The model species selected for the cross-domain database have been selected by experts and constitute a precious and reliable resource to perform large-scale comparisons. The database can be accessed online via dedicated web pages and web services (REST API). Second, the toolbox provides access to complex analysis scenarios allowing to explore evolutionary histories of genes and processes. In addition, OorthoInspector is also a standalone package that can infer orthology relations among user’s genomes.","OrthoInspector is a comprehensive International resource for biologist researchers, clinicians and students aiming at studying evolution and distribution of any protein families, either within a life domain or across the three domains. It also allows to study evolution of biological processes and perform genotype/phenotype correlations using phylogenetic profiling. It has already been used for training sessions (Master degree’s students). ","Human data (including Rare Diseases, Copy number Variations, Human cell Atlas)

"T1TAdb","Nicolas J. Tourasse","ARNA","INSERM U1212","146 rue Léo Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux, France.","nicolas.tourasse@inserm.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","The service T1TAdb is a database of type I toxin-antitoxin (T1TA) systems. It is freely accessible at https://d-lab.arna.cnrs.fr/t1tadb
Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems loci are small genetic loci found in most bacterial genomes including those of pathogens. They are usually composed of two adjacent genes: a stable toxin and a labile antitoxin, whose depletion rapidly leads to death or growth arrest. Six types of TA systems have been described so far depending on the nature and mode of action of the antitoxin. While the toxin is always a protein, the antitoxin can be either a protein (types II, IV, V and VI) or an RNA (types I and III). 
Type II TA systems are by far the most well studied class of TA systems. A database for these systems already exists: TADB 2.0 (http://202.120.12.135/TADB2/index.php). Although it focuses mainly on type II TA systems, it also includes data for other types, including type I. However, only a very limited number of type I TA loci are included (less than 50) and for some loci, information is lacking or inaccurate. 
A type I TA system consists of an mRNA coding for a small peptide that is toxic to the host cell and an antisense noncoding RNA that serves as a counteracting antitoxin. TA systems are studied for numerous aspects including RNA structure, toxin-antitoxin interaction, regulatory gene expression mechanisms (transcription, translation, degradation, processing), mechanism of action of the toxin, and function in cell physiology (survival and bacterial persistence). 
A few T1TA systems have been experimentally characterized, and hundreds have been identified by bioinformatic analyses. Most of them are not annotated in genome records. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a central repository. In our database, we have annotated the mRNA and antisense RNA coordinates corresponding to 18 families of type I TA systems. We developed a tool to automatically annotate these systems in bacterial genomes. Currently, our database contains around 1,700 T1TA loci focusing only on the ~700 genomes described in previous studies. We plan to expand this collection by predicting TA loci in all bacterial genomes available. 
This information, in addition to a wealth of sequence, structure, and genomic data on T1TA systems provided in our database, which is manually curated, would be a valuable resource for the scientific community. 
","Data","T1TAdb is a knowledge base on type I toxin-antitoxin (T1TA) systems. While hundreds of T1TA systems have been identified by bioinformatic searches, analyses focused mainly on the toxin peptide sequences. An added value of our database is that it provides the coordinates and structural diagrams of the toxin-coding mRNA and antitoxin antisense RNA for each locus. In addition, the database is manually curated. It does not currently take submissions from external users. 
","The T1TAdb database is aimed at the international research community working on toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. TA systems are found in most bacterial genomes and are studied for numerous aspects including RNA structure, toxin-antitoxin interaction, regulatory gene expression mechanisms (transcription, translation, degradation, processing), mechanism of action of the toxin, and function in cell physiology (survival and bacterial persistence). Therefore, research on TA systems encompasses structural, molecular, and cell biology, as well as genomics and bioinformatics. ","Microbial Biotechnology

"Bio++","Guéguen","Lab Biométrie et Biologie Évolutive","Université Lyon 1","16, rue Raphaël Dubois 69622 Villeurbanne cedex","laurent.gueguen@univ-lyon1.fr"," "," "," "," "," "," Bio++ project [1,2,3] aims at developing a set of C++ libraries for sequence analysis, phylogenetics, population genetics, and molecular evolution. The main attractiveness of Bio++ is the extensibility and reusability of its components through its object-oriented design, without compromising the computer-efficiency of the underlying methods. Bio++ offers a set of ready-to-use bricks to construct sequence analysis pipelines, develop new complex probabilistic models, run efficient maximum likelihood inference, simulate data, reconstruct ancestral sequences, perform substitution mapping, among other possibilities. Also Bio++ offers a large variety of models of sequence evolution for nucleotide, codon or amino acid sequences, within a generalized modelling framework. It provides many modelling methods such as site-specific and branch-specific modelling, covarion models, a large array of continuous or discretized distributions, standard algorithms for hidden Markov modelling. This generic implementation unifies the vast majority of models proposed in the litterature, and the free combination of all these tools allows the use of a huge variety of modellings without the need of further development.
In addition, Bio++ offers many tools dedicated to population genetics, including many  sequence diversity estimators. Graphical tools have been introduced in version 2.0.0 of the libraries.
The libraries have been conceived to cope with the increasing amount of genomic data, such as faster handling of sequences, support for sub-sequences and features, including parsers for many NGS formats (GFF, GTF, Phred, FastQ, MAF, ...) formats, as well as storage and manipulation of meta-data like quality scores. These new data structures enable a very efficient parsing and filtering of typical genomic data sets.

Several programs developed using the Bio++ libraries are distributed as the Bio++ Program Suite (bppSuite)(e.g. to perform maximum likelihood estimation, simulate sequences evolution, reconstruct ancestral sequences) and substitution mapping methods (TestNH). They all share a common language for the description of their parameters (BppO language), notably models of sequence evolution. With this language, one can easily specify which of the input/output formats, models, frequencies, discrete distributions, to use and perform depending on the chosen bppSuite program. Programs in bppSuite output their results in a BppO file, which can then be used directly as input for another program. This makes it easy for instance to use a previously fitted model to simulate sequences or reconstruct ancestral sequences. Through the BppO language and BppSuite, a large set of the features of Bio++ are made available to the user without the need for C++ programming.

There exist several other tools dedicated to phylogenetic reconstruction and molecular evolution modelling (PAML [4], PHYML [5], MrBayes [6], RaxML [7]. But Bio++ is the only one that offers such a variety of models, modelling tools, and algorithms, in a unified framework.

"CRB-Anim web portal","MARTHEY SYLVAIN","Animal Genetic and Integrative Biology (UMR1313)","National Institute for Agricultural Research","Domaine de Vilvert - bat 320 - 78350 Jouy-en-Josas","sylvain.marthey@inra.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","The CRB-Anim portal is the single access point to animal biological resources of the national infrastructure RARe. It aims at supporting research in genetics, genomics and physiology on domestic animals (pets and livestock) for public entities as well as private companies, including breeding companies, farmers associations. The corresponding database allows for queries on 140 000 samples available for about 70,000 animals in 20 species.
The referenced samples are documented: the portal manages more than 60 descriptors, of which 22 are mandatory. This requirement adds value to the biological resources managed by the portal by ensuring that the minimum level of characterization is the same for all samples. 
Through this minimal dataset required, and the use of controlled ontologies and vocabularies, the portal can provide effective search functionalities.
To respond to user needs, two different search modules have been implemented in the portal. The first, a ""google like"" module, allows the user to directly access the samples using the descriptors available in the portal: identification numbers (animal ID, sample ID, Biosamples ID, etc...), research project identifier, sample type, part of an organism, disease, species, breed, lineage, etc.... Keywords can be combined with the operators ""and"" and ""or"", which allows an informed user to perform complex searches effectively. The second, is a semi-guided research module. It allows the user to select values for the most commonly used criteria, but also to see all the values and associated samples for each criterion. Thus, the user can use this feature to explore and discover the available samples. As the number of samples meeting the search criteria can be very high, additional features have been implemented to allow the user to filter, sort, or download their results.
At the discovery stage, the anonymous user will be able to view the panel of samples available in the infrastructure by accessing general information on the samples (sample type, species, breed, disease, etc.) and metadata on the collections (number of samples and animals corresponding to the research criteria used, number of Biological Resource Centers with samples of interest, etc.). It will be able to select groups of samples of interest and interact with the relevant Biological Resource Centers (BRC) through a dedicated form.
In a second step, if the user wishes to access all the available information on the samples, he/she will have to make a request to create a user account on the portal. The account will be validated by the administrator before being activated. This will allow the authenticated user to access all search criteria and access all the information describing the samples through the individual sample records. Creating an account is mandatory to request storage or delivery of samples.
The portal was launched in sept 2017 and contained information describing a selection of samples from 5 animal resource centers. The main objective is to improve the quality and quantity of information related to samples in order to facilitate their use and to increase their joint referencing in Biosamples database (EMBL-EBI ELIXIR Node : https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/) and IMAGE Infrastructure (H2020 project : http://www.imageh2020.eu/). It offers a pipeline to either store or request samples, with full traceability on the basis of a material transfer agreement. The current priority is to train users and make the portal as user-friendly as possible. 
","Data
Tool
Interoperability
","The database is a knowledge base which has been set up by extracting information from the individual database of each animal biobank then converting it to standardized descriptors. The species committees, including scientists and stakeholders, validated the set of common descriptors for their species of expertise. New reference lists were created to improve the structure and quality of information. The new standards have been adopted by the biobanks and are used by the research community to search for samples via the portal. Sample description is validated by the curator of each biobank before its transfer to the database. The coordinator and the webmaster of the CRB-Anim infrastructure validated the final structure of the database which is updated every 6 months. Requests to the portal are submitted to approval by the species committee to assess relevance of a request in case the biobank has any doubt. Users can get information on samples, upload a request to store or to retrieve selected samples. ","The research community served by this project gathers scientists in animal genetics and animal breeding, in reproductive physiology, in cell biology and biomedical models on large animals. It is a combination of several disciplines in life sciences targeting domestic animals and their wild relatives as objects of their research. Searching all databases of the Web of Science returns more than 22000 scientific publications for animal breeding in 2017. A wide spectrum of biological diversity is involved with mammals, birds, fishes (freshwater and marine) and shellfish. It is surprising that no ELIXIR community has been identified for animals, considering the growing number of sequenced genomes and animal models for research. The portal is accessible in French and English and is open at the international level. The CRB-Anim portal is one of the databases on animal biological resources currently integrated in the IMAGE H2020 project (grant 677353). All data from CRB-Anim will become also accessible through the IMAGE information system that will gather similar data from more than 20 animal biobanks in Europe. Thus, CRB-Anim portal is truly oriented towards international visibility.","None","2017","Emerging","The portal is accessible at https://crb-anim.fr/access-to-collection. The main elements of access to samples and related data are as follows:
-Users have to create an account to request services, beyond the simple search for information about the primary descriptors of samples (i.e. species, breed, sex, tissue). 
- Samples are available for any user provided that (i) the request complies with initial conditions set up by the biobank with the provider (agreement of the provider, acknowledgement of the provider) (ii) the scientific quality and relevance is confirmed by the biobank and/or the species committee (new research, useful support to livestock sector, number of samples..).
  Information on the institution or legal entity of the user is needed to set up a material transfer agreement signed by the relevant authorities of the biobank and of the user. No transfer of samples can take place if this MTA is not signed.  
Direct communication takes place within the portal between the user and the biobank to clarify any issue. All steps are followed within the portal. 
A fee may be requested to cover storage, processing, shipment. 
A satisfaction survey is conducted at the end of the process
The portal has been realized in open code, there is no licence to pay to maintain it. ","The web portal is a web application hosted on a dedicated virtual server. The physical server and the virtual machine are managed by the CTIG, an INRA IT center whose missions and activities have been the management of national databases for livestock, under the responsibility of the Agriculture Ministry and breeding organizations, for over 40 years.  Supervision tools are in place to monitor server activity, the application and the stored data are backed up daily.
The portal's webmaster is able to resolve critical anomalies that can be reported with the contact form of the portal in order to quickly deploy a patch.
The web part of the site uses the JavaScript framework Angular, which allows for smooth navigation. All pages load instantly, except for the page which displays the results of the « google like » search, which can take several seconds to display. The performance of the portal is periodically evaluated.
The documentation is being deployed, it consists of two complementary elements: a reference documentation describing how it works, including tutorials and FAQs, and a contextual help available directly during navigation. 
The 68 descriptors of biological samples have been standardized using as much as possible international reference lists and ontologies when they existed (ncbi taxonomy, BRENDA, UBERON, EOL, ISO 3166-1, FCL, etc...). For some international standards, requests have been made to add new terms specific to pets. In other cases, it was not possible to use international standards, in this case, committees of experts in the field defined the values of the reference list.
The complete list of descriptors and their definition is available at this url : https://crb-anim.fr/access-to-collection/documentation/descriptors
Animal identifiers are official national identification numbers for the species for which they exist (dogs, cats, cows, sheep, etc.). For the others (poultry, fish), an identification standard has been defined for this database.
All information describing the samples and displayed on the portal and can be downloaded in CSV format.
Currently, the portal contains 140,000 samples from 70,000 animals in 20 species.
The last update of the data was made on July 31, 2018.
The last update of the application code was made on September 06, 2018.
","Since the portal was opened at the end of 2017, we are still in the learning phase for users. Each request is registered in the database so that indicators are automatically calculated : 
•	4 stocking requests from French academic scientists concerning a total of 11034 samples.
•	9 request for destocking from five French users (including one user from private company) concerning a total of 1638 samples.
•	5 information requests from 3 French users concerning a total of 126 samples.
38 users have registered since 2017 : 32 from public entities  and 6 from breeding companies or farmers associations, two of them are foreigners users.

It is organized on a crop basis with currently ten public modules: banana, breadfruit, cocoa, coconut, coffee, cotton, oil palm, rice, rubber tree, and sugarcane. Crop-specific web interfaces have been designed to allow quick consultations as well as personalized complex queries.
TropGeneDB can record crop information on: molecular markers, quantitative trait loci (QTLs), genetic and physical maps, genetic diversity studies, phenotypic diversity studies based on agro-morphological traits or traits measuring susceptibility/resistance to aggression (diseases, salinity, drought), and information on genetic resources (geographic origin, parentage, collection). Most of the data in TropGeneDB are original data not available in other Web information systems. Indeed, the TropGeneDB rice module stores unique genetic and phenotypic data on European collections of rice. The TropGeneDB banana module was identified by the Global Musa Genomics Consortium as a reference database for banana markers and genetic maps. No other equivalent database exists for most of our crop modules (breadfruit, coconut, rubber tree, sugarcane). Our resources contain data about important crops for the agrarian economy of many tropical countries. Indeed, these data can be exploited for rational use of genetic diversity available from germplasm collections, genome mapping and marker-assisted selection.
One of the most recent evolution of TropGeneDB is the integration of a new module in order to manage the large amounts of genotyping data being produced by Next-Generation Sequencing methods.
At the national level, we have close collaborations with GnpIS which is an Elixir service provided by the Elixir France Node. GnpIs provides also integrated genetic and genomic information but on different crops. Developers of TropGeneDB and GNPIS co-coordinate a working group called IFB-Plant aiming at increasing database interoperability.
We are involved in the Elixir Excelerate WP7 (Integrating Genomic and Phenotypic Data for Crop and Forest Plants), and we contributed to make TropGeneDB data interoperable (in line with the ‘FAIR’ principles specified in WP5 Interoperability) and discoverable through controlled vocabularies (MIAPPE and Crop Ontology) and standardised phenotypic APIs (BrAPI).

They also assess the relevance of the submitted studies.
","The users served by the TropGeneDB are international researchers in the topic of plant breeding known as the science of changing the traits of plants in order to produce desired characteristics. 
It is not focused on a discipline since it hosts data from phenotype, genotype, QTLs and cartography studies.

Efficient bioinformatics tools are developed to produce structural models coherent with the input experimental data. The software ARIA (Ambiguous Restraints for Iterative Assignment), developed for more than 15 years at the Institut Pasteur, automates treatment of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data and calculation of protein structures by molecular dynamics simulation (http://aria.pasteur.fr). NMR spectroscopy provides high-resolution data to elucidate protein structure and dynamics but is an indirect method that requires correct assignment of the observed signals, where manual analysis is very tedious and error prone. The tool ARIA is a fully automated protocol to generate accurate and reliable protein structure and assignment of the NMR data. The key principle behind the tool is the concept of Ambiguous Distance Restraints, introduced in 1997 by Michael Nilges, head of the Structural Bioinformatics Unit at Institut Pasteur.  ARIA is well established in the structural biology community, with a large user basis (more than 1000 worldwide). Since 2000, the development of ARIA has been continuous, both in term of usability and efficiency. New algorithms, compatibility with external software and formats (e.g. CCPN, https://www.ccpn.ac.uk/) are regularly integrated into ARIA to improve user experience and accuracy of the results. As developers of the ARIA tool, we participated in a community effort to assess the performance of resources like ARIA (CASD-NMR). It was demonstrated that ARIA is one of the two top tools available (the other one being CYANA, developed by the group of P. Guntert in Germany). In addition, we are committed to make our tool compliant with the open-source NMR exchange format (NEF), the format that will soon be the only accepted by the World Wide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) for the mandatory deposition of NMR restraints (https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.3041). With support from IFB, we are in the process of releasing a web portal for ARIA, where users will be able to manage and perform ARIA calculations. We also built on our experience with ARIA to develop a new related tool (ARIA-EC) for protein structure prediction form residue co-evolution (https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/bis-aria/ariaec). Additionally, we teamed-up with the YASARA software developers and implemented a new wrapper in ARIA to use YASARA as a structure generation engine (http://www.yasara.org/yaria).","Tool","ARIA is software package written in Python and interfaced with the CNS (or YASARA) software (for molecular dynamics simulations). After installation, ARIA provides routines to convert users data from many proprietary formats to the internal ARIA format (XML). A graphical user interface (GUI) is provided to specify input data, calculation parameters (if different from defaults) and required outputs. The main ARIA calculations are started by command line and can be executed locally, on a computed cluster or on a remote grid. The main outputs consist in quality reports (text and graphics), deposition-ready PDB and restraints files.","The ARIA tool mainly serves the structural biology community at the international level. It is used routinely by many groups that employ solution-state or solid-state NMR to characterize the structure of proteins or protein complexes.

Reaction rules are generic descriptions of chemical reactions. They can be used in retrosynthesis workflows in order to enumerate possible biosynthetic routes connecting a target molecule to precursors. The use of such rules is becoming increasingly important in the context of synthetic biology applied to de novo pathway discovery and in systems biology to discover underground metabolism due to enzyme promiscuity.

Current resources for reaction rules present some drawbacks, some are focusing on some specific applications or having restricted access. For instance, BNICE.ch, which is only available under license; Chematica, that consists of reaction rules extracted from Reaxys for organic synthesis available under commercial license.

RetroRules is an open-access database that provides a complete set of reaction rules, extracted from public resources and expressed in the community-standard SMARTS format, augmented by a rule representation at different levels of specificity.

RetroRules is freely available to download as an SQLite database that interrelates reactions, rules, metabolites, protein IDs, and a rule score based on biochemical diversity. All protein sequences, chemical structures and parent reactions data are available in their respective public databases (namely UniProt and MetaNetX databases).

Future developments will include additional capabilities such as the integration of chemical reactions from the BRENDA database – which recently joined the ELIXIR Core Data Resources – or other community-driven biochemical knowledge resources.

AskOmics is a solution to convert tabulated data into RDF and create SPARQL queries intuitively and ""on the fly"". The AskOmics software aims to facilitate the efficient use and integration of raw data by non-expert users using Semantic Web technologies. It therefore addresses three challenges: automatic creation of data relations schemes, assistance to the iterative construction of semantic queries, facilitated data integration with Linked Open Data (LOD) knowledge sources. Unlike spreadsheets, AskOmics offers rich querying capabilities exploiting the relations between entities and the associated semantics. Unlike relational databases, AskOmics allows large-scale data to be integrated within a flexible scheme that can be easily and iteratively enriched with new relations according to the production of new data. Unlike traditional SPARQL endpoints, the AskOmics framework allows data to be easily queried without a priori knowledge of the data structure nor of the SPARQL language. As a final feature, AskOmics is LOD compliant as data and queries can be shared in a flexible way by combining a local use of the tool but also a shared used via a cloud-based deployment.

Development. AskOmics has been released in 2017 as a result of a combined initiative for INRA (French Institute of Research in Agronomy), INRIA (French National Institute of Computer Science and Automatics) and University of Rennes. It is open source and available on github (https://github.com/askomics/askomics). Its development was supported by the French Institute of Bioinformatics (IFB). An example of deployment of AskOmics is available at : http://openstack-192-168-100-32.genouest.org/askomics/

Positioning and originality. More than 1500 databases co-exist in life science, each able to answer important questions in a particular domain. It is crucial to combine this knowledge to answer question that span domain boundaries. Classical data management technologies used by the life science community range from data storage in the form of multiple tabulated files analyzed with spreadsheets, silo models in complex database management systems with a predetermined scheme of federated data such as Intermine or Biomart, to ad-hoc community centralized models such as in bio-imaging communities. These solutions address immediate integration needs but they are poorly compatible with scalable and flexible integration, either between communities (for example to jointly analyse medical imaging data and genomic data) or with the world of linked data to enrich analyses with symbolic knowledge selected in a fine and contextual way. 
Another key approach for the combination of complementary datasources is based on the Semantic Web Technologies, an extension of the current Web that provides an infrastructure integrating data and ontologies in order to support unified reasoning. Thanks to the growth of linked data, supported by the Linked Open Data initiative (LOD), more and more reference databases are integrated according to these technologies and are available in RDF format in datawarehouses called triplestores like those stored at EBI. A bottleneck for a broad adoption of these technologies by the life science communities is a technical barrier: a complete analysis scheme based on Semantic Web technologies requires users first to prepare their data according to a RDF framework to make them exploitable by Semantic Web technologies, then to become familiar with querying modes in order to analyze the built triplestore in relation with the other triplestores of the LOD. Several initiatives allow users either to convert their structured data from tabulated files or relational databases to the RDF format, or to query RDF triplestore transparently. However, no initiative makes it possible for end-users to easily create a RDF triplestore from usual data formats and to flexibly create the queries allowing the data to be analyzed: when generated automatically, the structure of data triplestore is not transparent so that is it impossible for end-users to imagine all the queries that can be built from the links contained in the structure. Local views based on a partial exploration of the graph of data favor some relations among others and do not provide a complete information on possible links between entities. 
--> AskOmics provides answers to these three limitations by extracting knowledge about the data structuration (i.e. data types and their  relationships) from the headers of the user's CSV file or from standard files such as GFF, BED or SBML in a so-called ""abstraction"" coded in RDF as well.

Evidence of community outreach and adoption. AskOmics was developed quite recently with the support of Elixir-FR. It has been adopted by the French Institute of Research in Agronomy to store and explore several research project resources such as Agroecosystem arthropods (https://bipaa.genouest.org/is/). Training sessions have been done to facilitate its used by INRA bio-analysis. AskOmics has also been used for research projects in marine biology (IDEALG project, https://idealg.u-bretagneloire.fr, LPGP laboratory https://www6.rennes.inra.fr/lpgp_eng/). It is under deployment by the SANOFI biomedical company. It therefore can be considered as a national resource with no limitation to be used at the European level, since it a stand-alone and independent tool.

Positioning/links with EU infrastructures. The current implementation of AskOmics allows the construction of federated queries with the Uniprot and the Gene Ontology triplestores. Any EU database available as a RDF triplestore can be integrated as a distant resource of AskOmics according to the user's needs.

Interoperability
","AskOmics is a solution to convert and create queries ""on the fly"" based on the graph of relations between the data. The AskOmics software aims to facilitate the efficient use of raw data by non-expert users using Semantic Web technologies. It therefore answers to three difficulties: automatic creation of data relations schemes, assistance to the iterative construction of semantic queries, use of LOD knowledge sources by facilitating the interoperability of databases. 

AskOmics is made of three software blocks: a web interface for data import, allowing the creation of a local triplestore from user's datasheets and standard datas); an interactive web interface allowing ""à la carte"" query-building; a server performing interactions with local and distant triplestores (queries execution, management of users parameters).
AskOmics can either be deployed locally thanks to container technologies (https://hub.docker.com/u/askomics/) or be deployed on cloud-based infrastructures (for multi-users triplestores).
","AskOmics can be used by any community (or any individual user) concerned with the exploration of heterogeneous data. Ongoing case-studies are related to Agriculture, Plants, Marine Biology, Microbiology and Health.

The experimental approaches used to understand the biological functions of plant genes are numerous and complementary: genetic and physical mapping, transcriptome and proteome studies, full-length cDNA and EST sequencing, RNAseq mapping, insertion mutants... The genomes of the model plants are used as physical references to gather and merge all the generated information and therefore to optimize functional predictions. Indeed, the biological interpretation of large quantities of data requires their integration, organization and visual representation.
Organizing the data around the chromosome sequences allows one to reduce the redundancy of the information and references, but also to easily study the concepts of synteny and genome evolution and the relationships between the structure and the function of the genes. It is only with this general overview that the functional study of genes and the orthology quest will be possible, taking into account patterns of regulation and roles and relationships of genes in particular physiological states. Therefore, the ultimate objective of this project is to develop a database and associated bioinformatics tools based on the integration of genomic data around a selection of plant complete genomes. This tool will help users to understand the biological role of plant genes by considering them in a wide context: a multigene family, a topological environment, and/or a functional network.
The database and the associated user-friendly interface (in Java 1.7+) are developed with a conceptual effort for the graphical display and the hierarchical organization of the data. The running integration involves the structural and functional international annotations, ESTs from different plant species, novel gene predictions, mutant tags, gene families, protein motifs, transcriptome data, repeat sequences, primers and tags for genomics approaches (DNA chips, synteny studies, BAC library screening, RT-PCR, SNP discovery, ...), subcellular targeting, secondary structures, 3D models, MPSS tags, curated annotations and mutant phenotypes.

Quantitative metagenomics is broadly employed to identify genera or species associated with several diseases. These data are obtained by mapping the reads of each sample against operational taxonomic units (OTU) or a gene catalog. SHAMAN (shaman.pasteur.fr) [Quereda et al. 2016 (PNAS)] was one the first web application that allowed to clinician and biologist to perform an interactive analysis of quantitative metagenomics data with a dynamic-interface dedicated to the diagnostic and to the differential analysis. The interface integrates the experimental design (association of sample to one or several conditions), the statistical process for differential analysis and a real-time visualisation system.
Methods:
SHAMAN is based R, Shiny and DESeq2. The analytical process is divided into four steps : count matrix/annotation submission, normalisation, modelisation and visualisation. The count matrix is normalised at the OTU/gene level using the DESeq2 normalisation method and then, based on the experimental design, a generalised linear model is applied to detect differences in abundance at the considered taxonomic level.
Results:
Two years later, we can see a great interest from the metagenomics community with 3 publications using SHAMAN, 74 active users per month (1430 unique visitors since first publication) and 514 downloads of the docker application. Several developments are now available since first publication : a full automatized bioinformatic workflow for target metagenomics, a docker application for local installation on windows/mac/linux (aghozlane/shaman on docker hub) and several new visualizations for the quality check and a phylogenetical perspective of the abundance.

AuReMe (AUtomatic REconstruction of MEtabolic models) is a plateform designed to house “à la carte” reconstructions and analysis of GSMs while ensuring that their metadata is properly stored and can be efficiently explored and distributed. It includes a battery of tools to exploit heterogeneous data through customizable pipelines. At each step, relevant information is stored, ensuring reproducibility and documentation of processes. Furthermore, exploration of models and metadata during the reconstruction process is facilitated through the automatic generation of local wikis. This view offers a user friendly solution to iteratively explore genome-scale metabolic models produced with personalized pipelines and poorly interoperable tools. It is particularly adapted to the study of non-model eukaryotic organisms`such as algae or host-microbial consortia. An example of the wiki associated with the host-microbial metabolic networks made on a family of one macro-algae and 10 associated bacteria is available at http://gem-aureme.irisa.fr/ecto_bacteria/index.php/Main_Page 
The corresponding RDF query interface is available at http://openstack-192-168-100-32.genouest.org/askomics/


Originality.   AuReMe and its internal packages make it possible to design, query and study either eukaryotes metabolic networks or host-microbial consortium as several levels of details : (1) wiki-based explorations of redundancies, (2) construction and exploration of data links within metabolism with semantic queries (3) combinatorial-based design of microbial consortia. 
-	AuReMe is complementary to the main metabolic network platforms such as Microscope, Pathway Tools, the Raven Toolbox, The SEED, KBase in the sense that is can import and export metabolic networks created from these plateforms to enrich them with additional analysis while keeping a trace of the customization procedures.
-	Another originality is that the metabolic networks built with AuReMe can be exported either as a local wiki (enabling their exploration), or as a RDF triplestore which can be queried with semantic based technologies. 
-	The last originality is that AuReMe include several original combinatorial-optimization packages for the study of non-model organisms and host-microbial consortia such as : the Miscoto python package or the MeneTools packages.

Development. AuReMe was developed in the framework of the study of marine biology (ANR-investment for the future program IDEALG) and then extended as a generic resources. AuReMe and its associated packages (Padmet, MeneTools and Miscoto) are available at http://aureme.genouest.org/download.html. Several examples of wiki associated to eukaryotes and host-bacteria communities are shown on this webpage. 
Dockerfiles (for version tracking) are available on the inria Gitlab https://gitlab.inria.fr/DYLISS/aureme

Positioning/links with EU infrastructures. AuReMe relies on the MetaNetX dictionary, a EU resource as well as on enzymes (Uniprot) and biological compounds (CheBi) ressources to reconcile reaction identifiers extracted from heterogeneous sources.  
","Tool","The AuReMe software includes an adaptable pipeline for the refinement of metabolic networks, the export of (possibly multiple) networks as wiki and their interpretation in a RDF format to perform complex queries on multiple strain consortia enriched with multi-omics data such as expression data (linked with the AskOmics tool).
The service provided by the GenOuest platform (Elixir-FR western france node) includes facilities to run and install the wiki and rdf-triplestores produced by the system, for example, on cloud based infrastructures.

Transposases (proteins involved in IS transposition) are one of the two the most represented proteins in all genomes.
The project is divided into two major types of activity. Both are intimately connected to the ISfinder database. The first involves a better layout and interface of ISfinder itself and the development of tools necessary to exploit the information included in the database. The second stems directly from this and involves detailed analysis of the stored information.
The first part includes:
- the new version of the database (online in 2016) whichpermits classification of IS and their derivatives (MIC, MITEs, etc) and some transposons such as those of Tn3 family. 
- The development of ISsaga,
- recoding information
- Updating and keeping track of IS classification
The second part corresponds to scientific projects generated by analysis of the database. ISfinder is a part of GDR3546  “Les Eléments Génétiques Mobiles: du mécanisme aux populations, une approche intégrative (Mobile genetic Elements : from mechanism to populations, and integrated approach).
ISfinder provides a service either by assistance with the annotation (advice, sequence checking) or by the annotation of genomes for French or foreign units / teams (INRA, DOE, JC Venter Institute, NIH, Brazil). We collaborate with PFAM for the reannotation of the functional domains of transposases.

","Data
Tool
","International Reference Center for Prokaryotic Insertion Sequences (IS), ISfinder, is a public database (https://www-is.biotoul.fr) and a research tool which performs an important service for the microbiology community. ISs are small mobile genetic elements (MGE) which essentially code for the functions necessary to their transposition. Transposases (proteins involved in IS transposition) are one of the two the most represented proteins in genomes.
In addition to the database, the site provides specific tools for the scientific community. ISsaga is a semi-automatic tool for genomic IS annotation, it also allows the visualization of complete and partial IS in expertly annotated prokaryotic genomes. This second part needs to be improved and further developed.
The activities of the permanent staff are: expert curation of insertion sequences, database administration including interactions with outside users, logistical assistance to individuals or sequencing centers including genome annotation; database analysis including definition of new IS families and new types of mobile element, inference of regulation of expression, effects on host genomes, distribution and diversity; specific group projects. As part of the Reference Center, we also maintain a nomenclature system and distribute IS names

It supports microbial genomes (re)annotation and comparative analysis. Briefly, it is made of three main components: (i) a production system which contains more than 25 external/internal bioinformatics software organized in workflows to handle the simultaneous processing of several new microbial genomes, (ii) a DataBase Management System (PkGDB) in which primary data, computational results, and human-curated annotation are consistently organized in a non-redundant way (MySQL relational DBMS), and (iii) Graphical User interfaces (GUI) organized in several main categories (Genomic tools, Comparative genomics, Metabolism, etc.) to explore genomes and perform genomic and metabolic expert annotations. MicroScope provides data for about 10,000 completed and ongoing prokaryotic genomes together with post-genomic experiments (i.e., transcriptomics, re-sequencing of evolved strains) allowing users to improve the understanding of gene functions. It combines tools and graphical interfaces to analyze genomes and to perform the manual curation of gene functions in a comparative context.

In ten years, the platform has gained a solid reputation in microbial genome analysis services for worldwide microbiologists (60% of the MicroScope accounts are from foreign origin) and several recent papers compare it to the concurrent integrated systems developed in USA, namely IMG (JGI DOE) and PATRIC. MicroScope was involved in several national and european projects and is currently a main actor in the ELIXIR Microbial Biotechnology community.

It is the only online tool that represents and compares genomes in a broad phylogenetic view. Unlike alternative tools, the breadth and the nature of biological questions are not restricted by the number of genomes being compared. 

Genomicus provides graphical representations of multi-species genome comparison, at the level of one locus (conservation of synteny around a reference gene of interest),  or at the level of the entire karyotype (evolution of karyotypes). It also provides pairwise genome comparison tools, based on gene homology and/or computation of syntenic bloc conservation.

At the present time, different Genomicus browsers are currently maintained by the DYOGEN group at IBENS, dedicated to different groups of eukaryote species: vertebrates, plants, non-vertebrate metazoa, fungi, and protists. These instances are based on data downloaded from the Ensembl and Ensembl Genome databases. Consequently, every gene object in Genomicus is linked to its corresponding instance in the relevant Ensembl database. These browsers effectively represent a front-end to display Ensembl data in a way that is not available elsewhere. Three other instances are available, dedicated to specific research projects (Tunicates, Amphioxus, and Rainbow trout genome).
For the vertebrate and plants Genomicus interfaces, ancestral genome reconstructions provide an additional layer of information that is entirely new, i.e. not available in the Ensembl databases. To obtain this data, we computed ancestral gene content and organisation for each ancestral node of the phylum (e.g : currently 84 ancestral genomes for vertebrates, 36 for flowering plants) using the AGORA algorithm developed in the DYOGEN  laboratory. Since 2010 (first public release of the Genomicus Web Server), new functionalities have been added to the server and regularly described in publications. It is widely used by the community (more than 140 publications citing Genomicus, 150.000 requests per month). Furthermore,  the Ensembl database implemented links back to Genomicus through their gene tree representations, since the first release.

Genomicus Vertebrate is released at the same frequency as Ensembl releases (approximately every 2-3 months) to maintain the link between the two databases.

","Genomicus provides 3 levels of services:
1.	A graphical front end for data collected, stored and displayed by the Ensembl project. 
2.	A graphical front end for data that is available in an array of other websites (laboratory depositories, NCBI, UCSC) collected, analysed and provided by the DYOGEN laboratory (ancestral reconstructions, project-specific databases such as rainbow trout, Pegasus non-coding elements and target genes). 
3.	A graphical user interface for the PhylDiag algorithm which allows users to compute on-the-fly syntenic blocs between any two genomes stored in the database. 
Genomicus therefore does not take submissions from external users. It is an added-value database, where the dynamic and intuitive graphical representation and the ancestral genomic context provide powerful tools to exploit genomic information. 
","Users of Genomicus cover a broad range of situations: (i) biomedical researchers interested in connecting a gene of interest to its homologs in other species, biologists interested in studying the evolutionary history of a specific gene family, (iii) genome scientists interested in performing genome-wide comparative analyses (iv) teachers performing “hands-on” courses to students.

"Pasteur MLST: Institut Pasteur genomic taxonomy database of microbial strains","Sylvain BRISSE","Biodiversity and Epidemiology of Bacterial Pathogens","Institut Pasteur","25 rue Dr Roux Paris","sbrisse@pasteur.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","-	Strains of microbial pathogens are numerous, dynamic, and can acquire novel pathogenic or antimicrobial resistance properties.  Whereas the classification and naming of microbial lineages is unified at the species level and higher taxonomic ranks, universally accepted definitions of sublineages (‘strains’) within species are largely missing. 
-	The Institut Pasteur genomic taxonomy database of microbial strains (“Pasteur MLST”) is a free, publicly-accessible resource that hosts nucleotide sequence-based definitions of microbial strains, along with information on bacterial isolates (provenance data) and their genomic sequences. The Pasteur MLST database provides universal nomenclatures that are largely adopted for important pathogens (Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Listeria, …), and represent a unifying language on strains for microbial population biology.
-	Unified strain taxonomies facilitate the coordinated international surveillance of bacterial pathogens. Several hundred research laboratories and public health agencies worldwide have deposited novel strain types, sequences and provenance data on their bacterial isolates. For example, the Listeria strains nomenclature has been adopted by the PulseNet International Network, the largest food-and waterborne disease surveillance network, coordinated by the US CDC (Center for Diseases Control, Atlanta).
-	Pasteur MLST is powered by the Open source GPL3 BIGSdb web application developed at Oxford University (Keith Jolley & Martin Maiden). (http://bigsdb.pasteur.fr ). Its evolution in terms of functionality is tightly linked to the developments of the software at Oxford U. Its evolution in terms of contents is managed by dedicated international teams of curators for each bacterial pathogenic species, coordinated by the PasteurMLST team. 
-	The genomic taxonomies hosted at Pasteur MLST represent unique, authoritative resources that are highly valued by the community, as testified by the routine use of Pasteur MLST strain tags (e.g., K. pneumoniae ST258 or Listeria monocytogenes ST6, see for example http://www.who.int/csr/don/28-march-2018-listeriosis-south-africa/en/ ) in the scientific literature.
-	Positioning regarding ELIXIR resources: no specific idea
-	Pasteur MLST is of high interest and value to EU agencies such as ECDC (Public Health), EFSA (food safety) or animal health agencies. 
","Data","-	Pasteur MLST is a deposition database in which submissions are received on a daily basis by several teams of curators (approximately 10 curators in total) distributed internationally. Curation is performed at distance via web pages of using scripts. Curators typically are experts in the population biology of the bacterial pathogens under study. 
-	Pasteur MLST is a knowledge base. The submitted data (isolate provenance data, sequences) are checked for quality (sequence coverage, Phred score, completeness) and consistency (e.g., species identification, recombination/mix-up, and phylogeny) before data integration. Individualized feedback to submitters (mostly, microbiology or public health agency labs) is performed. 
","Pasteur MLST serves two main categories of communities. First, the basic microbiology research community uses the resource as a unifying language of bacterial sublineages. It allows recognizing and naming subtypes within the population structure and helps advancing knowledge on the genotype-phenotype relationships (e.g., virulence, ecology). 
Second, the resource serves the clinical microbiology and public health sector, by enabling the recognition of emerging pathogenic strains (e.g., novel multidrug resistant lineages), outbreaks (detection of same strain in several distantly related patients analyzed by different labs) and source tracing (e.g., matching genotypes of food isolates and patients isolates). The resource is critical in the ‘One Health’ and ‘Global Health’ perspectives.

The resource is cited in the evolutionary biology, microbiology and infectious diseases literature. The BIGSdb software tool publication itself (Jolley and Maiden 2010) was cited over 1000 times. The individual species strain taxonomies are cited by countless publications on hospital, food or animal epidemiology.

LoRDEC uses short reads to correct long reads; it combines sequencing data from both the second (2GS) and third (3GS) generation technologies. It can be easily integrated in any pipeline for processing deep sequencing data.
Its originality is to avoid aligning directly short reads against long reads (or vice versa) ; instead, it aligns the long reads against a graph that summarises the set of short reads. LoRDEC was the first tool to propose this graph alignment approach for error correction.
Thanks to this algorithmic strategy and to a memory economic implementation, LoRDEC is extremely efficient and can process very large datasets. It is the main rationale, besides the quality of its correction, that let numerous users adopt it for genomics and transcriptomics projects (see citations).
The source code, as well as installation procedures, has been actively maintained and improved since publication (in 2014). The users can install it on Linux and MacOS systems using a variety of procedures (including conda). We also provide parallelisation scripts for computing clusters (running under SGE or SLURM schedulers).

When reporter strains are grown in a microplate, the fluorescence and the absorbance (optical density) of the culture can be automatically measured every few minutes in a highly parallelized way. The resulting data contain quantitative information on population-level gene expression that is highly valuable for a variety of applications. Fluorescent reporter genes and microplate readers have become standard technologies in experimental biology and biophysics laboratories.

The extraction of useful information from reporter gene data is not easy to achieve, because the fluorescence and absorbance measurements are only indirectly related to promoter activities and protein concentrations, requiring mathematical models of the expression of reporter genes for their interpretation. The development of methods to process the (noisy) fluorescence and absorbance signals and estimate time-varying promoter activities and protein concentrations from the data has become a lively research area. Although the principles of the analysis of reporter gene data are well-established today, there is a lack of general-purpose bioinformatics tools based on generic measurement models and sound inference procedures. This often prevents biologists from making the most of their data.

This state-of-the-art has motivated the development of the web application WellInverter, based on linear inversion methods that were first presented at the ISMB/ECCB 2015 conference (Zulkower et al., Bioinformatics, 31(12):i71-i79, 2015). The transformation of the original version of WellInverter into an application that is robust and scalable, offering a guaranteed quality of service in terms of response times and availability, has benefited from the one-year funding of a software engineer by the Institut Français de Bioinformatique (IFB). WellInverter was available on the cloud IFB-StratusLab since autumn 2017 and has recently been redeployed on the new cloud Biosphère. In addition, WellInverter is accessible through a server at Inria and available as a stand-alone application that can be locally installed. One of the major novelties of the new WellInverter version is a plug-in system for the parsing of data files produced by microplate readers from different manufacturers, which will make the application useful for a broader range of users.

WellInverter is routinely used in the group of the developers and other laboratories in our close environment. We have received positive feedback from these users, often experimental biologists that are not familiar with the mathematical methods underlying the analysis process. We feel, however, that the potential of WellInverter to support the research communities concerned by the analysis of fluorescent reporter gene data is currently underexploited, especially as we are not aware of other web applications at the same level of maturity. This has motivated our current efforts to improve the visibility of WellInverter, among other things by the preparation of a paper on the new version of the application that is to be submitted in the software track of BMC Systems Biology by the end of October. The application for the labeling of WellInverter as an IFB/ELIXIR-FR resource is another step in this direction.
","Tool
Compute
","WellInverter is a web application implementing linear inversion methods for the reconstruction of gene expression profiles from fluorescent or luminescent reporter gene data. As input, WellInverter imports the primary data file produced by a multi-well microplate reader, containing time-series measurements of the absorbance (optical density) as well as the fluorescence and luminescence levels in each well (if available). Various modules exist to analyze the data, in particular for detecting outliers, subtracting background, estimating growth rates, promoter activities and protein concentrations, visualizing expression profiles, computing statistics on replicate profiles, exporting the analysis results for further analysis, etc.

The server part of WellInverter is based on the Python library WellFARE, the computational core of the application. We developed a parallel computing architecture with a load balancer to distribute the estimation queries over back-end servers running WellFARE. The server part additionally provides methods for managing experimental and user data. The client part of WellInverter is the graphical user interface of the application, working in a web browser. It allows the user to upload, analyze, and visualize the results of a reporter gene experiment as well as exporting the results in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. The client part is written in Javascript, and communicates with the server using JSON-encoded data and Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript) calls. WellInverter uses a plug-in system for defining high-level routines for parsing data files produced by microplate readers from different manufacturers. Parsers for Tecan and Perkin-Elmer microplate readers are currently available.
","WellInverter supports the analysis of population-level reporter gene data generated by microplate readers. These methods have become standard tools in most (micro)biology, biophysics, and biotechnology laboratories, not only in France but also abroad. We estimate that in France alone there are on the order of 100 groups producing the kind of data that fall within the scope of WellInverter. Because appropriate bioinformatics tools for the analysis of the data are currently lacking, most groups we know analyze the data using ad-hoc scripts written in general-purpose scientific software (R, Matlab, Python, Origin, ...).","Proteomics

","2017","Mature","Access to WellInverter can be obtained in different ways, depending on the level of use of the application.

First, for researchers who wish to explore WellInverter before deciding on its use, a demo version can be accessed at the following address: https://wellinverter.inrialpes.fr. The demo version does not allow the user to upload his or her own data sets.  However, sample data sets are supplied: two primary data sets of E. coli fluorescent reporter gene experiments as well as a completely treated version of one of these data sets.

Second, WellInverter is accessible through the cloud Biospère of the French Institute for Bioinformatics (IFB) after creation of an IFB account. Contrary to the previous IFB cloud, treated data files cannot be stored on the server and the user needs to download and locally save the analysis results before the end of the session. WellInverter is also deployed on an Inria server at the following address: http://ibis-public.inrialpes.fr:8000/. Contrary to the IFB version, no user registration is needed.

Third, a stand-alone version of WellInverter is available. The use of this version requires the application to be locally installed, contrary to the options above which only require an Internet connection and a web browser. In the case of intensive use of WellInverter or specific data protection issues, this option may be preferable though. Moreover, the analysis results can be locally stored. A stand-alone version of the software can be obtained from the WellInverter web site (https://team.inria.fr/ibis/wellinverter/). 

The WellFARE Python package that forms the computational core of the WellInverter application is distributed under an LGPL licence. The source code of the server side (load balancer, data storage, data security, …) and the client side (GUI) of WellInverter are made freely available for non-profit use to academic users. Interested companies can gain access to the server and client code of WellInverter under conditions to be negotiated with the institute of the project partner (INRIA). Preferably, this will involve co-development in the context of a joint scientific collaboration, where the code is made available to the company at no charge in return for the possibility to make interesting newly developed functionalities available in WellInverter.
","The new version of WellInverter, developed with support of the IFB and deployed since autumn 2017, has strongly improved the quality of service of the application. We have put in place a parallel computing architecture with a load balancer to distribute the estimation queries over several back-end servers, which reduces the response time of the computations to a few seconds even if several requests are made simultaneously. We completely redesigned the graphical user interface and developed a plug-in system for the parsing of data files produced by microplate readers from different manufacturers. The application has on-line help functions and comes with a tutorial available at the following address: http://ibis.inrialpes.fr/people/dejong/WellInverter/tutorial_WellInverter_new.pdf. Moreover, a demo version of the application with test data sets has been put in place: https://wellinverter.inrialpes.fr. The analysis results can be exported in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  format for further processing in other tools.","The number of people having used WellIverter since the autumn of 2017 amounts to a few dozen, about half of which have installed the application locally on their computer. The paper describing the linear inversion methods and a prototype of the actual web application has been cited 10 times (Google scholar). As mentioned above, we feel that the potential of WellInverter to support the research communities concerned by the analysis of fluorescent reporter gene data is currently underexploited, especially as we are not aware of other web applications at the same level of maturity. This observation is one of the motivations for applying for the IFB/ELIXIR-FR label.","10","5","V. Zulkower, M. Page, D. Ropers, J. Geiselmann, H. de Jong.

Several workflows managers have been proposed to deal this problem. Some of them (such as Galaxy) are targeting user giving graphical interfaces to easily design workflows but they are not very efficients to perform large scale analysis and in some cases did not allow parameter the whole set of software options. Others ones, (such as Snakemake or Nextflow) allowing to design customizable and complex workflows through a command line interface but users needs robust bioinformatic skills to launch or modify pipelines.
TOGGLe (Toolbox for Generic NGS Analyses) was developed to allow running complex pipelines without require any programming skills. It offers a simple way to build complex and completely customizable workflows for a broad range of NGS applications.TOGGLe manages, controls, verifies and concatenates every step in your workflow, checks structure and compatibility of steps given in the software parameters file, builds a workflow and launches it. TOGGLe reports parameters, commands executed, software versions as well as errors if they occur. Results are organized in a structured tree of directories. TOGGLe allows compressing or removing intermediate data and it uses scheduler capacities. TOGGLe integrates a large panel of tools for NGS analyses (demultiplexing, cleaning, trimming, calling, assembly, structural variation detection, transcriptomic ...) and post-analyses (haplotype detection, population structure ...). This workflow manager is highly flexible on the data type, working on sequencing  raw  data  (fasta, Illumina,  454, Pacific  Biosciences and more recently Nanopore), as well as on various other formats (e.g. SAM, BAM, VCF). This NGS workflow manager allows running parallel analysis or global, where several samples will be analysed together.  TOGGLe is user-friendly, as only basic Linux commands are requested: all parameters are provided through a simple human-readable text file. 
TOGGLe was used on more than 50 large sequencing projects with high number of samples (up to 3000), or high depth sequencing (from 0.5 to 8000x) or both. It was shown to be highly adaptable to various biological questions (evolution, phylogenetics, functional genomics, ... ) as well as to a large array of computing architectures (from laptop to large HPC clusters) and data (DNAseq, RNAseq, CaptureSeq, SmallRNA, GBS, …). TOGGLe was used in more of 20 publications so far, and for more than 15 trainings worldwide. 
TOGGLe is developed in open source by the French South Green platform since 2014, following the Agile methods, in order to fastly answer to local, national and international biological projects. The philosophy of development is based on unitary tests and functions, making of TOGGLe a brick-like tool for modulating bioinformatics pipelines. From the first static version published in 2015, TOGGLe evolved to a biologist-aimed workflow manager, very versatile and efficient, implementing numerous tools and possibilities. A broad range of tools were included following evolution of technologies (short reads to long reads) and algorithmes (e.g. TopHat to HiSat), as well as pre- and post-analyses (QC, format control, phylogenetics, population structure), rendering data input and questioning more flexible. TOGGLe can be implemented in any VM from the IFB cloud on demand, as well as on any infrastructure of HPC. In addition, recent additions in its code for using Singularity containers allow fast and efficient deployment on any infrastructure.

","TOGGLe is biologist-aimed large-scale workflow manager, using basic text file and a single command-line, allowing to create ad hoc pipeline for your analysis. It can be used for any number of samples (up to 3000 tested so far), any type of NGS-like data (WGS, DNAseq, CaptureSeq, RNAseq…), and any type of questions (transcriptomics, SNP detection, population structure and so on). The idea of TOGGLe is to offer to biologists the possibility of using super large computing systems to analyse their own data without support.","TOGGLe has been installed on various HPC clusters (IRD/France, CIRAD/France, TGCC/France, ICT/Vietnam, IRRI/Philippines, Nestlé/Suisse…) and much more single computers (from laptops to servers) worldwide. We estimated it has been used in 20 published projects and 50 unpublished one yet.  TOGGLe is frequently used as tool for training in Europe (France, Spain), Africa (Benin, Senegal, Ivory Coast), Asia (Vietnam, Philippines).

W4M started as a collaborative project, especially funding by regional grants and national French grants. The French Institute of Bioinformatics (IFB - ELIXIR-FR) and the French Infrastructure for Metabolomics and Fluxomics (MetaboHUB) have therefore joined their complementary expertise to develop and maintain  the Workflow4Metabolomics infrastructure (W4M) bioinformatics resource for online metabolomics data analysis (http://workflow4metabolomics.org/; Giacomoni et al., 2015).
					
W4M resource is based on the Galaxy environment that provides user-friendly interfaces to build, run, and share comprehensive data analysis workflows (Guitton et al., 2017) and gives access to a High Performance Computing environment the ELIXIR-FR/IFB infrastructure. Thus, W4M offers more than 40 tools to process data from all three main technologies (NMR, GCMS, LCMS), including unique algorithms developed by the W4M developers themselves. Data and workflows can be re-used and publicly shared, thus becoming useful references for the community. Finally, the platform provides many tutorials and a help desk. W4M R&D effort aims to implement new galaxy data visualization tools and improving the interoperability of existing resources (MetExplore, [REF] MetaboLights [REF], MassBank [REF] or PeakForest [REF], by providing these services through Galaxy and by making new connections from Galaxy to other services. W4M e-infrastructure is also the first repository for data analysis workflows dedicated to metabolomics, allowing case study histories sharing through the W4M public web portal and associated with a digital object identifier (DOI) which can be cited in publications.

In term of evolution, the main objective is to ensure that W4M become an international strategic research e-Infrastructure serving a broad range of users from academic researchers to private partners with, increasing the sustainability of the proposed service, supporting data integration and interoperability on data services and investing in standardizations (ISA Tab, mzML formats ...).[A completer]

W4M has more than 1300 users worldwide and provides R&D services to small teams as well as big consortia, such as the cohort project from MetaboHUB (Pujos-Guillot et al., 2017) and the ANR-RHU CHOPIN project (CHOlesterol Personalized INnovation). Since 2014, W4M proposes regular trainings as workshops and summer schools (RFMF, H2020 PhenoMeNal, …) and its Workflow4Experimenters (W4E) annual international course. In term of metrix, W4M as data analysis e-infrastructure was cited in 88 scientific publications and reviews since 2014. 

W4M was the first first worldwide implementation of a metabolomics data analysis workflow system. Since 2016, W4M supported several initiatives and projects (MetaboFlow consortium funded by the Wellcome Trust, ChemFlow, ...) relevant for both sustainability as for development of tools for a larger community scope. Today, W4M plays a key role in new ELIXIR “Metabolomics” and “Galaxy” communities and is involved in the ELIXIR Implementation Study on Metabolite Identification led by ELIXIR-NL. W4M is being currently supported by IFB and MetaboHUB to become a core service (Service Delivery Plan) from ELIXIR-FR.
			
Finally, W4M was involved in the PhenoMeNal H2020 e- infrastructure project led by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) where CEA and INRA are partners. The aim of PhenoMeNal is to propose an e-infrastructure for the analysis of large scale human phenotyping data.

This innovative and extensible e-infrastructure proposes a complete metabolomics data analysis environment based on the Galaxy workflow management and a high-performance infrastructure. The W4M service is organized in three axes: tools, training and data.
 - Tools: LC/MS, GC/MS, FIA-MS and NMR data treatment pipelines including more than 40 tools for preprocessing, normalization, quality control, statistical analysis and annotation steps. 
 - Training: Workshops, Open-course, MOOC and its annual courses (tutoring on participants’ data since 2015). Publication of standard operating protocols and tutorials centralized on W4M public portal.
 - Data: Sharing and referencing of histories and workflows (DOI).
Finally, W4M provides a multidisciplinary team support help desk including IFB/MTH biostatisticians, bioinformaticians, software and high performance computing engineers and data scientists.
","By the nature of the tools provided, the users are focussed on metabolomics studies. Our project supports Mass Spectrometry (MS) and Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data.

The workflow4metabolomics.org galaxy instance provides a public service for academics and commercial companies. To access to the Galaxy instance and for security reasons, an account should be requested for free (http://workflow4metabolomics.org/account). The opening itself, after some manual checkings, can take 2 or 3 opened days. With official W4M credentials, each user would access to all data analysis tools and reference workflows, posting bugs or asking questions to the W4M official support.

Workflow4Metabolomics attaches great importance to the protection of personal data and privacy. To continues to serve EU users, W4M gives them control of the way their personal details are used with the update of our privacy policy (http://workflow4metabolomics.org/privacy_policy). W4M is based on the Galaxy framework. The Galaxy Project cares about privacy preserving regulations and meeting the requirements of EU law known as General Data Protection Regulation. So W4M follows Galaxy community recommendations to be GPRD compliant (https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/special_topics/gdpr_compliance.html)


In term of distribution, the majority of W4M Galaxy wrappers are available on GitHub, or on  institutional code repositories (INRA, …) and on the Galaxy Main ToolShed. Codes are distributed under a GNU-GPL 3 licence. The R package developed by W4M members are available in the Bioconductor repository under the open source CeCILL licence.
","On the technical point, the Workflow4Metabolomics webportal is hosted on a up-to-date CMS platform. On its side, the W4M Galaxy resource is maintained by a team of 3 system administrators and the whole service is hosted on a supervised virtual infrastructure ( providing cpu, memory, network, and storage informations in real time) with daily backup for virtual machine and Galaxy databases. Supported data formats (input and output data for and from data analysis workflows) are based on main metabolomics standards (MSI, COSMOS, PhenoMeNal, ...) and use computing data sharing formats as plain text, TSV, XML and JSON. W4M is starting collaboration with EBI and the “Food and Nutrition ELIXIR community” to connect the W4M data analysis platform to EU reference data repositories as MetaboLights and ENPADASI and providing adapted format like ISA-Tab.

In term of release, the Workflow4Metabolomics infrastructure is mainly based on the Galaxy framework. So it can rely on the worldwide community to get security patches, quick debugging and new features. The code is open-source and available through GitHub and through the Galaxy ToolShed. The project implements Continuous Integration (CI) directly link to Github to test the functionality of the tools itself (R, implementation in Galaxy) and so prevent integration problems. The W4M project closely follows the latest development and actuality of the Galaxy project. The last update of the platform was in september 2018 and the frequency adopted is three major updates per year.

Our end-users can rely on the W4M core team to address their technical issues or scientific questionings via a helpdesk (support@workflow4metabolomics.org or direct Galaxy reports). A survey is regularly send to the users to gather their feedbacks and needs. 

To promote the use of high quality data analysis workflows in metabolomics, on its own infrastructure,  the W4M core team propose for 4 years an annual international course (in English) with half theory and half tutoring session where the 25 attendees bring their own data and analyse them during a full week. W4M is also an active team with the development of self training tools with the first edition of its MOOC, usemetabo, (in French), opening in October 2018, funded and supported by CNRS, IFB, INRA, Rennes 1 University, MetaboHUB and RFMF). W4M is preparing also an open course (2019) and

Data available are under different forms, from complete genome sequence along with gene structure, gene product information, metabolic pathways, gene families, transcriptomic assays, genetic markers as well as genetic and physical maps. Several Genome Hubs were released: Banana, Cassava, Cacao, Coffee, and others (e.g. Rice, Palm, Grass Magnaporthae) are currently under development. Strong partnerships are engaged with the community to ensure that the latest information in available through the Hubs. Within each international crop community, we actively participate in the building of a community of practice for communicating and sharing information. As an example, we can cite the banana genome hub with connections built with breeding information from MusaBase  (BTI/Cornell University). Another example is the Rice Genome Hub, currently in development, for which we are creating synergies within the International Rice Informatics Consortium.
We opted for GMOD components that are open source, modular, portable and benefiting from a large community support in which we have been involved. We also plugged in-house tools developed by the South Green bioinformatics platform such as SNiPlay, Gigwa, daTALbase, PathosDB, and DiffExDB. Similar resources are Ensembl Plants but at a different scale since we focus only on a subset of priority tropical and mediterranean crops as well as a few pathogens.

","On case by case basis, submissions (e.g. RNAseq, GBS, etc.) from an international community of researchers is the adding value of the service (deposition database).
For some hubs, genome manual annotations have been added by experts, using the Artemis annotation tool directly connected to the Chado database (knowledge base).
","Last year, according to Google Analytics, 5,200 different users used the Banana Genome hub, compared to 4,200 for the Coffee Genome Hub. Looking at the geographical level,  48% come from Asia, 28% from the Americas, 17% from Europe (including 30% from France), 4.5% from Oceania and 2.5% from Africa. The order is a little different for Coffee with America at the first place with 47%, Europe 27%, Asia 20, Africa and Oceania 3%.

The Hub relies on URL integration of resources using a common uniquename and semantic terms (e.g. ontology). Other bioinformatic systems are integrated using HTML iframes such as GreenPhyl and Pathwaytools. Updates are performed once new genomic or transcriptomic datasets are available for each community. For instance, the last update was conducted in 2017 for banana
For each Genome Hub, a form is available to report a problem or to make suggestion to improve the website. 
Some trainings are organised with different dynamics according to the communities.

SeaView combines network access to sequence databases, alignment with arbitrary algorithm (e.g., Muscle, ClustalO), alignment trimming, tree building with maximum likelihood/maximum parsimony/neighbor-joining methods and display, printing, and copy-to-clipboard of rooted or unrooted, binary or multifurcating phylogenetic trees. In relation to the wide present offer of tools and algorithms for phylogenetic analyses, SeaView is especially useful for teaching and for occasional users of such software.

SeaView can read and write the most widely used file formats defined for holding aligned or unaligned protein or nucleotide sequence data: Fasta, Phylip, Clustal , Nexus and Mase. The last two formats allow for much useful information besides sequence and name, that is, trees, species, and sites selections, sequence annotations. SeaView can also import sequence data from the major public sequence databases using a network access to daily (for GenBank and EMBL) or weekly updated (for UniProtKB) databases. Imported sequences can be identified by name, accession number, or keyword and named either with their database identifier or using the species name of their organism of origin.

SeaView relies on external programs to perform multiple sequence alignments. Two programs are initially available: ClustalO and Muscle. These programs are run with their default parameter values that have been chosen by their authors to perform well in most cases. When special parameter values are needed, they can be specified once using SeaView's user interface and reused for subsequent alignment operations. Alignment can be applied to all or to selected sequences or part of sequences. Profile alignment that aims at adding more sequences to a preexisting alignment can be done with both Muscle and ClustalO. SeaView is also able to drive any external sequence alignment program provided this program reads and outputs Fasta-formatted sequence data and can be run by a command line of the form “program_name arguments.”

SeaView relies on PhyML for maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree reconstruction. Here again, PhyML is used as an independent program. Thus, updates to PhyML will be accessible to SeaView users as soon as they will have installed the revised program. Tree building can be applied to all or to selected sequences and to all or selected sequence sites. Most PhyML options can be set through the graphical interface, both for nucleotide and protein-level analyses. Thus, branch support can be estimated either with the approximate likelihood-ratio test or by bootstrap resampling.","Tool

"myProMS","Patrick Poullet","U900 - Bioinformatics Platform","Institut Curie","26 rue d'Ulm, 75248 Paris Cedex 5 FRANCE","patrick.poullet@curie.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","Mass Spectrometry (MS) has become a powerful technique to characterize the protein contents of complex biological samples. myProMS was developed to help MS facilities and researchers to collaborate more efficiently by providing a centralized web solution to manage, analyse and interpret MS-based proteomics data. Most if not all MS tools and software are designed for MS specialists and sometimes bioinformaticians. The ability of being also usable by end-users with limited knowledge of MS technology (biologists, clinicians) is a unique feature of myProMS. In addition of optimizing the collaboration between these communities with complementary expertise, it greatly simplifies the work of the MS facility. Indeed, following upload onto the server, the data generated can be quickly processed and made accessible to collaborators. Few other MS tools referenced in ELIXIR are also based on a centralized Web Server (QuPE, ProHits,…), but besides offering fewer features than myProMS, these solutions are clearly designed for users with extended knowledge of MS technology.
myProMS offers a vast array of data-processing, analysis and visualisation functionalities. To accomplish this, it relies on multiple other tools and pipelines; some of them also referenced in ELIXIR: the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP), MSstats, MassChroQ, OpenMS, Mascot, . 
myProMS is being developed and actively used at Institut Curie since 2004. Instances are also deployed in MS facilities of Institut Cochin, Paris (contact: François Guillonneau) and Ecole Supérieure de Physique Chimie Industrielle (ESPCI), Paris (contact: Joëlle Vinh).
In nearly 14 years of development, myProMS has evolved with the MS technology. The latest feature implemented is the handling of Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA/SWATH-MS) data processing including spectral libraries generation and management. During this period, the amount of MS data routinely generated has exploded. To cope with this amount of data to process myProMS is now compatible with cluster computing and parallel processing.
","Tool","myProMS is a web server linked to a MySQL database. It allows mass spectrometry teams or platforms to upload and further process results from MS search engines such as Mascot, Proteome Discoverer or MaxQuant. Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA/SAWTH-MS) analyses are also performed. Data are stored and organized within control-accessed projects. Identification lists can be easily mined, compared and exported. Different sample-labelling strategies (Label-free, SILAC, iTRAQ/TMT) are handled to perform protein and modification-sites quantification/differential analyses. In addition, exploratory (PCA, clustering) and functional analyses (GO, Pathway).  The software relies on various home-made and community-used tools and scripts. It is high-throughput-ready through optional cluster computing usage.","The resource is intended to be used by researchers and engineers working in the field of Mass Spectrometry(MS) -based Proteomics. Because of data privacy issues, one instance of the server should be deployed per MS facility (which usually means one per institute) and be used by members of this facility and their collaborators (biologists, clinicians …); the later potentially belonging to different institutes. Alternatively, myProMS can also be installed on a laptop computer for single-user access.","Proteomics","2004","Mature","Online production servers are not directly accessible to anonymous users.

The originality of the service is five-fold: i) tight integration of genomics data with rich contextual environmental description of the data’s origin, ii) provision of quantitative gene abundance estimates, iii) user friendly streamlined web query form iv) graphical interactive results as well as classical machine readable raw data, and v) live results in seconds to minutes. Obtaining equivalent results without the OGA service requires several days of work by a skilled bioinformatics expert with access to high performance computing.

They are very attractive microbial secondary metabolites, displaying a remarkable diversity of structures and functions with applications in many fields (health, agro-food, cosmetic, biocontrol).
Microorganisms synthesize these metabolites thanks to huge enzymatic complexes called NonRibosomal Peptide Synthetases (NRPSs) working as multi-domain assembly lines. These enzymes select and bond together a wide variety of building blocks, that are called monomers, including proteogenic and nonprotegenic amino acids and their derivates, fatty acids, carbohydrates. More than 530 different monomers have been identified so far. Furthermore, the nonribosomal peptides are not only linear but can also contain cycles and/or branches. These specific structural features require the development of dedicated tools, especially for their structural comparison. Norine fulfils this need by providing a knowledge-base containing valuable annotations on NRPs and tools to analyse them efficiently.
Other data/knowledge-bases contain some NRPs among other small biological molecules such as ChEMBL, PubChem or StreptomeDB. However, Norine is the only one dedicated to NRP metabolites. So, it contains specific and relevant annotations, in particular a home-made notation of NRP structures. It is a graph representing the monomers and the bonds between them, enabling description of complex 2D structures. This representation connects the structure of these metabolites to their synthesis pathway that bonds together monomers. This structure representation enables the development of relevant tools that enhance the reliability of NRP analysis. For example, the genome mining tool antiSMASH identifies NRPS clusters and predicts the monomers that are incorporated in the produced NRP. A direct link to Norine is provided to compare this predicted structure to the real ones stored in Norine. 
As our knowledge-base is reliable, the worldwide Protein DataBank (wwPBD) organization and BIRD (Biologically Interesting Molecule Reference Dictionary) reference Norine among the DBREF in their entry files that contains nonribosomal peptides. Norine reference back their entries and provides links to other resources : ChEMBL, PDBe (+ RCSB-PDB and PDBj), UniProt, MiBIG, PubChem and StreptomeDB.","Data
Tool
","Norine knowledge-base contains manually curated annotations about NRPs, extracted from scientific literature. Most of these annotations were fill in by members of the Norine team, and since 2015, Norine is open to external expert sourcing. Anyway, each submitted data is validated manually by Norine team members before being available in the website. Some additional annotations are extracted automatically from other databases.
The resource is also associated to specific tools developed by Norine team members : an editor and a visualizer of the monomeric structures, home-made algorithms to compare monomeric structures and s2m that infers monomeric structure from chemical structure.","Norine resource is useful for any worldwide scientist interested in natural product discovery. This includes researchers in the field of microbiology, structural chemistry, metabolomics, microbial biotechnology, pharmacology, phyto-chemistry, biocontrol... It's may be of interest to point out that marine environment represent an untapped source of micro-organisms producing  nonribosomal peptides. Mining of marine metagenomes will end with prediction of NRPS gene clusters and identification of active NRPs.","Metabolomics

It gives access to abundant and valuable annotations on NRPs through a user-friendly interface. The entire knowledge-base can be browsed, searched (among annotations and structures), downloaded and accessed by web APIs.
We have a short ""Terms of use"" section on our homepage.","Norine currently contains annotations on 1190 nonribosomal peptides and 534 monomers. Addition of new peptides or new annotations are done as and when. The last modification was validated in July 2018.
The knowledge-base nearly meets FAIR principles. Unique identifiers are associated to each NRP or monomer and can be used to retrieve annotations through an URI. Scientific articles or books used to annotate the peptides are referenced in the entries, supplemented by identifiers of external databases sources. Norine team is studying the FAIR data principles and will do the changes needed to be totally in compliance with them.
All annotations can be downloaded from the website or access by REST services in several formats (HTML, CSV, XML, JSON).

We participated in the development of several open source tools (GKarrays, DigiTag, CRAC, CracTools, ChimcT, SimBA, DE-Kupl) and we are involved in various ANR/FRM/FRANCE GENOMICS data mining projects on  RNA biomarkers caracterisation (including long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), miRNA, splice variant, fusion/chimeric RNA …).
Our originality and expertise is : 1 / The treatment of RNA-seq data and the search of fusion genes in cancers with extension to genetic diseases (Bouge et al), development of a complete pipelines, comparison of procedures, benchmarking..
2 / The annotation dedicated to the fusion RNAs: using Fusion RNA database used in diagnostics in cancers, and new annotations by expression profile research and tumor specificity (with a personal  method based on specific kmer search in large sets of RNA-seq data)
3 / The design of an Encyclopedia of k-mers dedicated to ""specific pathologies and subgroups"" constructed with the integration of different  diagnostic markers detectable in RNA-seq data (including fusion RNAs, mutations, expression profiles, variant splicing ect ..). 
4/Pipelines for the detection of human and mouse non-annotated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) (including DE-Kupl and conventional pipelines).
5/Benchmark of pipelines for RNA-seq analysis (comparison of procedures for detection of fusion RNAs, mutations,  lncRNA …)
Moreover, our facility proposed bioinformatics services on “classical” RNA-seq analysis (Sequence Quality, mapping, reads counts, differential analysis…) and services for the data mining of public RNA-seq at a large scale (>1000 RNA-seq). 
One of our focus consists on the characterization of chimeric fusion RNA or RNA (chRNA) in cancers through dedicated software and pipeline developments. Our strategy is to use software and pipelines developed and benchmarked by our team (see publications). Our originality consists in detecting  fusion or chimeric RNAs already used in diagnosis and also in detecting new biomarkers that can be used in personalized medicine for the follow-up of residual disease of cancer patients or the individualized follow-up of the treatment response.
The methodological component, which consists of software and pipeline developments, includes several partners. Several software declarations have been filed with the Montpellier University for the following software (Digitag, Gkarrays, CRAC, CracTools, Chim-CT, SimBA). These programs have been the subject of accepted publications (Philippe et al, 2014, Philippe et al, 2011, Philippe et al, 2013, Bouge et al, 2017 and Audoux et al, 2017).This service is offered by the BIO2M platform which operates with services in bioinformatics. It’s now extended for specific medical diagnosis in oncology (mainly in hematology). We are also asked by our geneticist colleagues University Hospital of Montpellier to test this approach in the case of chromothripsis (Bouge et al, 2017).
The second analytical component consists on  analyzing large RNA-seq data sets for the search for new fusion RNAs or others RNA biomarkers in different types of tumors. Currently, we have already tested our pipelines on large datasets already available (TCGA, SRA, ENCODE …). 
The third biological component consists of validating the selected biomarkers in tumor samples in order to study the recurrence and specificity of events, the expression of candidate RNAs biomarkers is  investigated in large cohorts.
We  developed pipelines for the characterization of new lncRNAs. The first method is based on a classical approach (including CRAC + StingTie + Kallisto + Deseq2). We are currently processing several hundred RNA-seq data from cancer patients and cellular models available for public access. The 2nd most innovative method is based on a k-mer approach developed with our partners (Audoux et al, 2017). These services is also proposed on the platform

DSIMB has a specific place in the ELIXIR as we have provided a series of more than 20 different solutions for Structural Bioinformatics community with various questions. It is so the most important provider of new services these last years in France. Each methodological development had been associated to (i) a publication in a peer journal paper and (ii) a webserver/database/software freely available to the scientific community. 
The tools focussed on (a) the analyses of protein structures (protein contacts, accessibility and residue volume, approach for splitting a 3D protein structure into compact subdomains, local protein conformation such as PolyProline II helices, protein superimpositions…), (b) specific development for transmembrane proteins (structural assessment of protein transmembrane domains, database of transmembrane protein structures positioned in the lipid bilayer, …), (c) prediction from sequences from flexibility to protein fold recognition, and (d) specific databases. 
Most of the DSIMB tools were (and still are) the most up-to-date in their field. For example, KNOTTIN is the reference database on protein knottin structural properties, the results of KNOTTIn is directly integrated in UniProt. Post Translational Modifications – Structural Database (PTM-SD) is the only database that linked PTM both experimentally annotated and structurally resolved.

We have 10 webservers, 6 databases and 5 software. We underline for each one its specificity.

Webservers: 
1. OREMPRO -A tool for the structural assessment of protein transmembrane domains. It is the only tool for which the user can change the size of the bilayer and so is more sensitive that the concurrent approaches.
2. ORION - ORION (Optimized protein fold RecognitION) is a sensitive method for protein template detection. It was the 2nd best fold recognition alone approach in CASP 11 competition.
3. iPBA - iPBA is a tool for protein structures mining and superimposition based on similarity in the local backbone conformation. Benchmarks have showed that iPBA was equivalent or better than other superimposition approaches on difficult targets. 
4. MulPBA - mulPBA is an efficient tool for comparison of protein structures based on similarity in the local backbone conformation. Benchmarks have showed that mulPBA was better than other multiple superimposition approaches.
5. PredyFlexy - PredyFlexy predicts from the sequence: (i) the series of Long Structural Prototypes (LSPs), a sophisticated structural alphabet and (ii) the protein flexibility, this last being defined from data coming from X-ray structures and molecular dynamics simulation. It is the best approach to predict protein flexibility in three classes (rigid, intermediate and flexible).
6. VLDP - VLDP webserver is designed to determine protein contacts, accessibility and residue volume using Laguerre diagram. It is the only approach based on Laguerre freely available and so quite useful to analyse protein structures, e.g. the only to provide accessibility.
7. SWORD- A partitioning algorithm capable of producing multiple alternative domain assignments for a given protein structure. The only one that can do that.
8. Protein Peeling 3D - An approach for splitting a 3D protein structure into compact fragments. The most used approach to cut protein into compact subdomains.
9. COUDES - A tool for predicting beta-turns and their type in a protein or peptide sequence. 
10. LOCPRED -A tool for local structure prediction from protein sequence using a structural alphabet approach.
 
Databases:  
1. KNOTTIN -The reference database on protein knottin structural properties. The reference on knottin protein since 15 years, it had been recently updated.
2. RESPIRE - Our database aims at providing a comprehensive structural view of the Red Blood Cell protein content. The new reference on RBC proteins.
3. TMPL - A database of transmembrane protein structures (α-helical and β-sheet) positioned in the lipid bilayer. 
4. PolyprOnline - Polypronline is a webserver dedicated to the assignment of PolyProline II helices. The only database that focus on  PPII.
5. PTM-SD - PTM-SD provides an access to proteins for which Post Translational Modifications are both experimentally annotated and structurally resolved. The one and only reference and updated database on PTM.
6. MitoGenesisDB - The database MitoGenesisDB focuses on the analysis of mitochondrial proteins.
 
Softwares:  
1- PBxplore. A suite of tools to explore protein structure dynamics with Protein Blocks. An innovative way to analyse Molecular Dynamics, and the only one that can distinguish between mobility and deformability. 
2- Maiden - MAIDEN (Model quality Assessment for Intramembrane Domains using an ENergy criterion) is a statistical potential (or pseudo-energy function) optimized on native membrane protein structures. 
3- Orion - ORION is a new profile-profile fold recognition approach that relies on a better description of the local protein structure to boost distantly protein detection.
4- ANVIL - ANVIL (Assignment aNd VIsualization of the Lipid bilayer) is aimed at assigning membrane boundaries to a protein 3D structure.
5- PredyFlexy software - PredyFlexy predicts from the sequence: (i) the series of Long Structural Prototypes (LSPs), a sophisticated structural alphabet and (ii) the protein flexibility.

The course includes 15 different modules aiming at developing a broad set of therorical and practical skills covering the main fields of bioinformatics: programming (Perl, Python, R), genome assembly and anntotation, transcriptome analysis, metagenomic analyses, variant calling, phylogenetic analysis and also text mining and structural bioinformatics. The value and quality of the training modules comes from a strong involvement of researchers and engineers of the MaIAGE research teams (StatInfOmics, Bibliome,…) in the course design and delivery, together with a solid expertise of the Migale platform in delivering software and computational services for biologists. The targeted end-user community of the training sessions include biologists deadling with (meta)omics data of broad range of organisms (microbes, farm animals, plants,…).

The training session modules are from 1 to 3 days long, all including an important praticipal part (at least half of the course). The 2018 session has had a total duration of 24 days (on a period of around three months).  A total of 110 persons were trained, half of then (53%) coming from Inra labs.

"ANISEED","Patrick Lemaire - Christelle Dantec","Centre de Recherche de Biologie Moléculaire"," CNRS","1919 route de mende 34090 Montpellier","contact@aniseed.cnrs.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","ANISEED is the main model organism database for the worldwide community of scientists working on tunicates (sister-group of vertebrates). The database was established 15 years ago, initially published in Current Biology (2006) and Genome Research (2010), with two follow up articles in the Nucleic Acid Research database issues (2016, 2018). It is listed in the NAR database collection. These four articles have together been cited 248 times. On average it is accessed in 2018 by roughly 1700 unique visitors/month (up from 900 in 2015), coming from all main international tunicate labs, who visited 170.000 pages/month (up from 82.000 in 2015).

The portal currently hosts 12 tunicate species. It integrates for each species: i) a main knowledge base with extended functional, gene expression, phenotyping, anatomical and phylogenetic information; ii) A multispecies genomic browser; iii) a Genomicus gene synteny browser. The tool is generic and adaptable with minimal adaptation to any developmental model organism.

Ascidian data originate either from in-house automated annotation pipelines (functional gene annotation, gene orthology, large scale in situ hybridization data), and extensive manually curated data by an annotator team using a set of specific tools (more than 300 articles entirely curated from the published literature). Leadership in data stewardship is attested by the recent co-authorship by the main ANISEED curator, Delphine Dauga, of an article describing FAIRsharing posted on bioRxiv, and accepted in Nature Biotechnology pending very minor modifications,. 

A first originality of the system lies in the class of organisms it covers. Second, its philosophy of data representation which, unlike many model organism databases, extends the purely gene centric approach usually adopted by providing entry points at the anatomical territory level. Finally, the system provides a detailed geometric description of morphogenesis (surfaces of contact, cell neighborhoods,...) which will be significantly enhanced over the next year (see below). 

ANISEED is embedded within a rich environment of public bioinformatics resources, including a range of ELIXIR services. For instance, all pharmacological reagents used to interfere with biological processes are described using the ChEBI dictionary. Genomics datasets are extracted using BioSamples. Links are established to ENSEMBL. Functional gene annotation makes use of Gene Ontology, InterPro, Pfam, Uniprot. Our orthology relationships pipeline uses PhyML, among other tools. In addition, ANISEED links out to non-molecular database, in particular ecology and taxonomy databases (WoRMS - World Registry of Marine Species, NCBI Taxonomy, GBIF | Global Biodiversity Information Facility).

Future developments include: i) the extension of data to new ascidian species and to appendicularians; ii) the interfacing of ANISEED and Morphonet, a web-based 4D anatomical browser allowing interactive exploration of developing embryos with cellular resolution (currently in revision at Nature Communication, login: public.access; password: public). iii) The extension of supported data to single-cell (ATAC-seq, RNA-seq) genomics datasets. iv) the streamlining of literature curation strategies using machine learning approaches.","Data

Interoperability
","ANISEED accepts submissions from the international community (pending their subsequent expert curation, see below). Users can also visualize private genomics datasets (Json track hubs) in the genomic browsers of ANISEED, in order to to interpret them in the context of all public annotations and without having to upload them on our server. 

Data submission is through two systems: large-scale data are entered programmatically. Small-scale literature data are entered by a team of trained annotators and subsequently curated by a biocurator through a dedicated curator interface. 

The database is a knowledge base structured around molecular, chemical and anatomical ontologies. General ontologies are used for molecular data (GO, ChEBI, SO). The systems biocurator is also in charge of co-developing dedicated ontologies (OBO format) when necessary (i.e anatomical ontologies of developing ascidians).","ANISEED is the main world-wide database for the international community working on tunicates (USA, Germany, Austria, United Kingdom, Japan, China, France, Italy, Spain, New Zealand..).The community counts approximately 70 labs and covers a range of disciplines (taxonomy and systematics, cell and developmental biology, gene expression, evolution..). 
The community is well structured and gathers since 2003 every two years at the occasion of the International Tunicate Meeting (2015, Aomori, Japan; 2017, NYC, USA; 2019, Villefranche/mer, France). A general round table discussion of the evolution of ANISEED takes place at every such meeting.","None","2004","Mature","All data in ANISEED are public except data from ongoing, unpublished genome projects hosted by the system’s genomic browsers as a service to the community and accessible via private links to genome and track hubs (currently 1 project from USA on one species).

Evry, Université Paris-Saclay","23 bv. de France, 91000 Evry, France","fariza.tahi@univ-evry.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","EvryRNA is a platform  providing seeral  bioinformatics software for the prediction of RNA structures and for the identification and prediction of non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), including small ncRNAs (microRNAs, piARNs, etc.) and long ncRNAs. These software correspond to different original algorithms based on sequence algorithmic and multi-criteria combinatory approaches, and machine learning approaches. The algorithms, all developed at IBISC, are published in international journals.

The tools dedicated to RNA structure prediction are Tfold (Engelen and Tahi, NAR 2010), BiokoP (Legendre et al., BMC Bioinformatics, 2018) and RCPred (Legendre et al., BMC Bioinformatics, 2018, to appear). Tfold and Biokop allow to predict the secondary structure of RNA including pseudoknots. Both allow to return several possible solutions. Tfold is based on the comparative approach and thus take at input several homologous sequences, while  BiokoP takes at input one sequence and combines two thermodynamic models (MFE and MEA). Tfold uses a sequence algorithmic approach while BiokoP solves a bi-objective integer program. 
Several RNAs can interact together and form complexes (of more than two RNAs). RCPred (Legendre et al., BMC Bioinformatics 2019) is a tool for RNA complex secondary structure prediction including pseudoknots and zig-zags motifs, and that returns several suboptimal solutions. RCPred  takes advantages of the numerous existing tools for in one hand predicting secondary structure of one RNA and in the othe hand for predicting interactions between two RNAs. RCPred takes as input numerous predicted secondary structures of RNAs and several possible interactions between each pair of RNAs. Then it returns the best combination according to an energy model. RCPred is based on a clique problem of the graph theory and uses an heuristic allowing to find good solutions.

The platform provides several tools dedicated to non-coding RNA identification and prediction. We have (i) miRNAFold (Tempel and Tahi, NAR 2012)(Tav et al., NAR 2016) and miRBoost (Tran et al., RNA 2015) for microRNA precursors (pre-miRNA) prediction, (ii) piRPred (Brayet et al., Bioinformatics 2014) and IpIRid (Boucheham et al., Plos One 2017) for piRNA prediction and (iii) IRSOM (Platon et al., Bioinformatics 2018)  for ncRNA prediction including long ncRNAs. Except miRNAFold, all are based on machine learning algorithms, and perform a binary classification of the input sequences. IpIRid is based on an integrative approach where many features (therefore many sources) can be considered: genomics, epigenomics, positions on chromosomes, etc. The features are implemented as kernels (Multiple Kernel Learning approach), and the user can choose the kernels to use in its predictions. IRSOM is a tool allowing to discriminate between coding and non-coding RNAs, with the particularity compared to the state of art to reject sequences that are ambiguous. Moreover, it offers practical results visualizations, thanks to the used SOM (Self-Organizing Map) machine learning approach.
miRNAFold is based on a sequence algorithmic approach, using a sliding window on a genomic sequence (which could be an entire genome) where pre-miRNA hairpins are searched for. miRNAFold is very fast and is the only one tool available as web server for pre-miRNA identification in genomes.

PGxLOD is an emerging linked open data resource that integrates elements of pharmacogenomic knowledge from various origins: reference databases, the biomedical literature and analyses of few Electronic Health Records studies. These pieces of knowledge are typically relating a
gene variant, a drug and an adverse event, stating that a patient having the gene variant and being treated with the drug will have a higher risk of developing the mentioned adverse event. For example, one piece of PGx knowledge is , stating that patients with the 202A version of the G6PD gene and treated with chloroquine (an anti-malarial drug) are likely to experience anemia (an abnormally low level of red blood cells in blood).

In addition to pharmacogenomic elements of knowledge, PGxLOD contains data about entities that are or may be involved in pharmacogenomics such as gene variants, genes, drugs, phenotypes and their relationships. These additional data come in particular from Drugbank, Sider, ClinVar, PharmGKB, KEGG, DisGeNET, UniProt.

PGxLOD is structured by a simple ontology named PGxO, which enables, along with the W3C ontology PROV-O, to represent precisely the provenance of its components. 

Aim
PGxLOD mainly aims at enabling knowledge comparison and knowledge discovery in pharmacogenomics. Knowledge comparison is made possible because PGxLOD goes along with reconciliation rules that enable to identify equivalent or similar pieces of pharmacogenomic knowledge. Knowledge discovery is ensured by the content of the graph that includes attributes of key pharmacogenomics entities, their inter-connections and their connection with ontologies. A first project of knowledge discovery resulting in the identification and prioritization of candidate pharmacogenes, by learning from PGxLOD data [3]. Because our resource follows semantic web precepts and FAIR data principles, many other pharmacogenomics-related hypotheses can be explored by mining PGxLOD.

Evolution
PGxLOD is being actively improved. We are for instance working on methods for tackling identity resolution more fully, i.e., being able to map similar entities represented several times in the graph. We are also enriching the dataset with data from connectivity maps, protein interaction, and even a private version of PGxLOD that will include patient longitudinal data, dedicated to translational studies. Note that Elixir resources IntEnz and PredictSNP are under consideration to improve our description of pharmacogenomic enzymes and to provide potential impact of their genomic variations. 
PGxLOD already implements the main principles of a FAIR resource, and aims at fulfilling more completely this commitment.
Note that these improvements, as well as exploratory use of the resource, will be investigated during the BioHackathon Paris 2018, organized by Elixir. A hacking task around PGxLOD is indeed supported by Elixir for this event. We already identified about 10 participants of the hackathon from 6 distinct institutions who will join these efforts.

Positioning
PGxLOD does not aim at replacing PharmGKB, the reference database of the domain that we love and largely consume. It provides a data science playground for comparing, moderating or confirming knowledge associated with various level of validation; thus, making knowledge in pharmacogenomics more actionable. Indeed, best outcomes of PGxLOD are planned to nourish PharmGKB and clinical guidelines emitted by the CPIC (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium). 
","Data
Interoperability
","PGxLOD is a knowledge base, but from a computer science point of view, in the sense that its data component are instances of classes and relationships of an OWL ontology. We do not provide any human curation on its content. But it represents and connects pharmacogenomics pieces of knowledge stated elsewhere: in reference databases such as PharmGKB, which is curated, or in the literature. We carefully associated with each piece of knowledge a provenance. Its added value is consequently to gather these elements of knowledge in one place and to use semantic web standards and tools which provide several advantages to facilitate knowledge comparison and knowledge discovery. ","At this stage, PGxLOD is emerging and is serving a national community only. We hope to extend this communittee at the Biohackathon Paris 2018. It focus on pharmacogenomics knowledge, which is key to the implementation of precision medicine, and is also of interest in pharmacovigilance since it provides, in some cases, molecular evidence for the molecular mechanism that may explain drug adverse event. Consequently the targeted communities are: bioinformaticians, clinical or biomedical informaticians who collaborate with pharmacologues, epidemiologists, population health scientists. We are particularly interested in opportunities of connecting PGxLOD with observational patient data to enable translational projects.

Any user can either programmatically or manually query our open Virtuoso server at https://pgxlod.loria.fr/ using SPARQL queries or the “facetet” browser. Users can also choose to download the full dataset, in RDF format. Then, the user can upload them in his own triple store. Third, we provide a Docker environment that allows to (i) deploy locally, or on premise, a virtuoso server, (ii) populate it with PGxLOD and (iii) optionally, adding your own data, that may be sensitive and requiring to stay on you own server. Few additional details are provided in the next section.","We offer 3 different ways for using PGxLOD. The first one, is our Virtuoso server at https://pgxlod.loria.fr/ that offers a SPARQL query endpoint and a linked data browser. The second is a full download of the dataset. In this case, the user can freely upload and use the data in his own triple store. The third, is a Docker environment that allows to deploy locally or on premise, a virtuoso server, populate it with PGxLOD data and optionally, your own data. 

The current version of PGxLOD is v3.2 and has been released Oct.1, 2018. Its release rate has been to one major new version per year so far. 

As an emerging resource, we did not setup a proper customer service. We simply have a unique email pgxlod-contact@inria.fr to centralize potential requests.  This service is deployed using automation tools (Puppet, Docker) under a dedicated virtual environment and as such it can be curated, rescaled or redeployed in a new environment very easily. It is monitored regularly for its availability using the UpTime service.","Our resource is in an emerging stage. It has been developed for the last 2 and half year, and just made public few months ago. As today, only 6 French labs started using it, for distinct research purposes in translational bioinformatics. We list here their aim in using PGxLOD.
European Hospital Georges Pompidou, APHP, Paris, Contact: Bastien Rance. HEGP deployed a local instance of PGxLOD, where it is enriched and connected with patient data extracted from Electronic Health Records. The resulting dataset is searched for frequent sequential patterns that are used, in turn, to better characterize patients who are either over- or under-sensitive to pharmacogenomic drugs.
University Hospital of Saint-Etienne, Saint-Etienne, Contact: Cédric Bousquet. The Saint-Etienne hospital is analyzing PGxLOD data in search for mechanistic explanations of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) of pharmacogenomic drugs. 
CRIStAL lab, Lille, Contact: Joel Legrand. The CRIStAL lab is developing Natural Language Processing methods to populate PGxLOD from the biomedical literature.
The LIRMM lab, Montpellier and the Ecole des Mines d’Alès, Contacts: Clément Jonquet and Andon Tchechmedjiev. They are developing interoperability approaches to improve mappings between data sources of the Linked Open Data. They particularly experiment with PGxLOD and pharmacogenomic use cases. 
Loria lab, Nancy, Contact: Adrien Coulet. One group (Orpailleur) is developing methods for knowledge comparison to compare pharmacogenomic knowledge that may be stated in several resources; Another group (Capsid, contact: Malika Smaïl-Tabbone) will study knowledge discovery related to pharmacogenomics of heart failure treatments, from PGxLOD and patient data.

We count only 4 publications mentioning PGxLOD so far, and all of them implies at least one member of its development team. 

We will present and work with PGxLOD during the BioHackathon Paris 2018 organized by Elixir. 
We hope that this venue will offer many opportunities to improve and share this beautiful resource*.

Cancerogenesis is associated with aberrant functioning of a complex network of molecular interactions, simultaneously affecting multiple cellular functions. Therefore, the successful application of bioinformatics and systems biology methods for analysis of high-throughput data in cancer research heavily depends on availability of global and detailed reconstructions of cancer-specific molecular networks amenable for computational analysis. 

Description 
Atlas of Cancer Signaling (ACSN, https://acsn.curie.fr) is a pathway database and an interactive comprehensive network map. The resource includes tools for map navigation, visualization and analysis of molecular data in the context of signaling network maps. The Atlas is a ""geographic-like"" interactive ""world map"" of molecular interactions leading the hallmarks of cancer as described by Hanahan and Weinberg. The Atlas is created with the use of systems biology standards and amenable for computational analysis. 
The maps of ACSN2.0 are organized in a hierachical manner.  They are decomposed into functional modules with meaningful network layout. Cross-referencing with other databases and links to the scientific papers that were used for creating the Atlas allows the user to study in depth the knowledge represented in ACSN2.0. 

Online platform 
Navigation of the ACSN is intuitive thanks to Google Maps-like features of NaviCell (https://navicell.curie.fr)   web platform based on Google Map engine. Thus the exploration of the Atlas is simplified due to semantic zooming feature, allowing the user to visualise the seamless Atlas and individual maps from ACSN2.0 collection at different levels of details description.
 
The integrated NaviCell web-based tool box in the ACSN resource, allows to import and visualize heterogeneous omics data on top of the ACSN 2.0 maps and to perform functional analysis of the maps. In addition, the associated NaviCom (https://navicom.curie.fr) tool automatically generates ACSN-based molecular portraits of cancer using multi-level omics data from cancer data resources as cBioPortal. 

Originality and uniqueness
The originality and uniqueness of the ACSN that it is a resource of multi-scale maps. ACSN thoroughly describes and graphically depicts not only mechanisms deregulated in cancer cell, but also the processes reflecting the role of tumor microenvironment in cancer progression.  In addition, cross-regulations between cancer cell and components of tumor microenvironment are systematically depicted. The resource now allows studying immune response in cancer due to this extension. The various components of tumor microenvironment are represented as individual maps and as integrated networks, opening the opportunity to capture heterogeneity in cell populations on tumor microenvironment.
 
An additional breakthrough is that the signaling mechanisms represented in the ACSN maps are cross-linked to the metabolic processes depicted in RECON map from Virtual Metabolic Human initiative (Noronha et al, 2018). This allows studying involvement of metabolism into cancer development and understanding regulation of metabolic circuits by cell signaling mechanisms in cancer and vice versa.

ACSN2.0 thoroughly describes and graphically depicts not only mechanisms deregulated in cancer cell, but also the processes reflecting the role of tumor microenvironment in cancer progression.  

Evolution
ACSN was released initially in 2013 and published in 2015 (Kuperstein et al, Oncogenesis, 2015). Since then, the resource was widely used by biomedical community for various applications (Monraz Gomer et al, 2018). Extensive work of biocurators and developers allowed us to expand the content of ACSN, leading to the release of the second edition of ACSN in 2018 which is twice larger comparing to the previous version and represents now a truly comprehensive source of cancer molecular maps. The ACSN content is permanently expanded with new signaling network maps and updated by the latest discoveries in the field of cancer-related cell signaling. In addition, ACSN is not only a cancer-oriented database: ACSN maps depict fundamental cell signaling processes and can be used in many domains of molecular biology.

Positioning in the community
ACSN and related services are part of Systems Medicine Disease Maps Community (http://disease-maps.org) and GARUDA alliance (http://www.garuda-alliance.org/alliance.html). It is currently in the process of being integrated into big international platforms as Wiki Pathways, Pathways Commons and NDEx. The resource is currently used to study disease comorbidities and to make suggestions for drug repositioning.","Tool","ACSN is a web-based knowledge resource of multi-scale biological maps depicting molecular processes in cancer cell and tumor microenvironment. The core of the Atlas is a set of interconnected cancer-related signaling and metabolic network maps. This is the only resource in the field that systematically gathers together unique and up-to-date information about mechanisms deregulated in cancer cells and tumor microenvironment. 

Constructing and updating ACSN involves careful manual curation of molecular biology literature and participation of experts in the corresponding fields. The cancer-oriented content of ACSN comprehensively covers the hallmarks of cancer and completely original.

ACSN contains the tool for data visualization using NaviCell platform that is user-friendly. Therefore, ACSN is not only a source of up-to-date information, but, equally important web-tool for data analysis and interpretation. 
","The resource is hosted at Institut Curie, Paris France. The maintenance and involves a team of biologists and bioinformaticians. The contribution of the international society to the resource expansion and applications is indicate on the website (https://acsn.curie.fr).

The recourse is oriented towards international society of clinicians, biologists, data analysists, modelers, informaticians. The content is rather cancer-specific.

","The suite contains 51 modular tools covering a wide diversity of tasks related for the analysis of genomic regulation: sequence retrieval, motif discovery, motif scan, prediction of regulatory variants, motif clustering, phylogenetic footprint detection, chip-seq analysis, background model computation, generation of artificial datasets for benchmarking. It is equipped with various utilities addressing common users needs, for example interoperability tools to enable interconversions between the multitude of alternative formats for the common objects handled in the domain (sequence background models, position-specific scoring matrices, genomic features, graphs, genetic variants, …). 
RSAT enables the extraction of  regulatory sequences from thousands of genomes gathered from diverse primary sources (mainly EnsemblGenomes and NCBI), these data sets are processed and installed locally in the RSAT servers to facilitate usage. Moreover, we recently included in the resourse a compendium of 51 collections of  transcription factor binding motifs used by various tools (sequence scanning, motif comparison and clustering), which we aggregated and clustered to build non-redundant motif collections. 
","Since 1998, RSAT has been freely available world-wide, and has been used by an international community of life biologists and bioinformaticians. 
It is focused on the analysis of cis-regulatory elements in genomic sequences but the tools are conceived in a generic way so that most of them can also apply to many other purposes in the context of modelling and analysis of any type of nucleotide sequence (motif discovery, motif search, background model estimation, generation of random datasets, sequence statistics, …). 

The suite handles a variety of objects such as nucleic sequences, motifs (regular expression, IUPAC and position-specific scoring matrices), genome annotations, genes, polymorphic variations (SNPs), operons, homology relationships, background models (Markov of any order), graphs/networks. 

The tools meet needs expressed by all communities of life sciences and their applications (health, agriculture, environment, biotechnologies, …), since they fit the growing need of tools to decipher genetic and epigenetic regulation following the multiplication of NGS technologies (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, …). 
In particular, the RSAT software suite meets the needs of several ELIXIR communities. We highlight hereafter some of the most obvious links. 


1. Plant sciences: RSAT plants supports 74 plant genomes, regularly updated by Bruno Contreras-Moreno (Zaragoza, Spain). 
2. Human data: RSAT metazoa supports Homo sapiens as well as the genomes of several model metazoa, which contribute to decipher and annotate “the” human genome.
3. Rare diseases + Human CNV: RSAT supports various tools for the analysis of regulatory variants, enabling to extract variant sequences, scan them with motif, and predict their impact on transcription factor binding; 
4. Marine ecogenomics: the different RSAT servers support a wide variety of genomes from all taxa, including marine organisms (provided that their genome has been sequenced).
5.Galaxy: we expect to develop interaction and take benefit of their expertise for the integration of RSAT in Galaxy. In 2016, we ported 6 RSAT tools under Galaxy (invocation via SOAP/WSDL web services). After having ported RSAT to Bioconda, its integration within Galaxy will be strongly facilitated. 
6. Microbial biotechnology: RSAT is particularly suited to the analysis of microbial regulation, where regulatory sequences are shorter than in pluricellular organisms, and for which the availability of hundreds (Fungi) or thousands (Bacteria) of genomes empowers the methods to detect phylogenetic footprints (conserved regulatory elements). 
7. Metabolomics: in the context of integrative bioinformatics projects, it will be of increasing interest to combine metabolomic studies with the analysis of gene regulation, in order to understand the mechanisms of metabolic adaptation.

Therefore, it is now crucial for researchers to have bioinformatics infrastructures at their disposal, that propose unified access to both data and related scientific articles. With the help of text mining tools, we can rapidly access and process textual data, link them with other data and make the results available for microbiology field.

The Florilege application ( http://migale.jouy.inra.fr/Florilege/ )completes knowledge described in other databases with knowledge from the literature on microbial biodiversity, as well as their comparison for further analysis. A key knowledge in microbiology is the microbial biotope and the phenotypes of the microorganism. Florilege is a database of habitats and phenotypes of food microbe flora : it aims to gather, in a unified representation, public information on food microbes with a focus on positive flora (microorganisms involved in transformation, bioconservation or probiotics).

Information content analysis and standardization calls for information extraction tools that can automatically analyze descriptions of microorganism biotopes so that biotope descriptions originating from different experiments can be compared at a large scale. Here analysis means not only the extraction of the relevant spans of text, but also the normalization or categorization with reference resources (e.g. taxonomy of organisms, ontology of habitat, ontology of phenotypes, ontology of physico-chemical properties, etc.). The text mining workflow is deployed on OpenMinTeD platform, and allow to reproduce the information extraction process. Information retrieval in Florilege is supported by a powerful semantic search engine that enables ontology-based query.

The unique organized information displayed by the Florilege application is publicly accessible online and offers researchers numerous cross-functional avenues of exploitation in different fields like food security, ecology, and human health.

The main source for information in Florilege is scientific articles but Florilege is integrating an increasing volume of textual and non-textual information from relevant biological databases such as Biological Resource Centers (e.g. Inra CIRM, DSMZ) and major genetic databases (GenBank).
","Data","Florilege is a knowledge base. The latest version dates from July 2, 2018. The database contains 810 194 Taxa - Habitat relations (PubMed: 708 286 ; GenBank: 79 397 ; CIRM BIA: 13 ; DSMZ: 22 498) and 42 390 Taxa - Phenotype relations (PubMed).

The ontology used for indexing habitats and phenotypes of microorganisms is OntoBiotope ( http://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/ONTOBIOTOPE?p=classes ), which is developed by INRA and available for discovery and download on AgroPortal.

The information is automatically extracted and interpreted from: 
•	PubMed references on microorganisms,

"MetExplore","Fabien JOURDAN","UMR 1331 TOXALIM","INRA","180 chemin de Tournefeuille 31027 Toulouse","Fabien.Jourdan@inra.fr"," "," "," "," "," ","Context: Metabolism of an organism is composed of hundreds to thousands of interconnected biochemical reactions responding to environmental or genetic constraints. This metabolic network provides a rich knowledge to contextualise omics data (metabolomics, proteomics, trasnscriptomics) and to elaborate hypothesis on metabolic modulations. Nevertheless, performing this kind of integrative analysis is challenging for end users with limited computer skills since it requires the use of various tools and web servers.

Scope: MetExplore web server aims at providing an integrative, collaborative and visual interface to curate and mine genome scale metabolic networks. MetExplore is not focus on specific organisms, in fact users can upload any networks as soon as they follow SBML standard format. Then users can edit these networks and use them to perform network analysis of their omics data (flux computations, pathway enrichment, sub-network extraction …). One key point of MetExplore is the visualisation of metabolic networks (or sub-networks). This feature allows an interactive mining of data.

Originality: MetExplore provides a unique framework in Europe for genome scale network based analysis which can be applied to any kind of organisms. Its focus on the network aspect makes it different from most metabolism databases (KEGG, BioCyc …) and the broad range of organisms allows various fields of applications in comparison to more specialised ressources (e.g. Virtual Metabolic Human). Moreover, MetExplore originality resides in its features for collaborative curation of metabolic networks (creating curation projects, sharing them …). Finally, MetExplore is well acknowledge for its original visualisation features. In particular, MetExploreViz (a web component that can be used in any other websites Chazalviel et al. 2017) is providing original visualisation features and interactive manipulation on large networks.

Strategy of evolution: MetExplore is a downstream analysis tool (after computational and statistical analysis of omics data analysis). The aim is to improve the interoperability of MetExplore with upstream data analsysis tools (in particular W4M) and to improve connections with omics repositories (e.g. Metabolights for metabolomics). On a methodological point of view, two main directions will be addressed (1) allowing integration of networks corresponding to different organisms to create ecosystems of networks (2) provide better ways to interpret the biological meaning of metabolic sub-networks (e.g. using text mining and semantic web approaches). MetExplore team will also continue the efforts in outreach activities, include FAIR practice (e.g. allowing to save sequences of jobs) and continue the effort to guaranty the sustainability of the service.

Evidence of community outreach and adoption: MetExplore was first published in Nucleic Acids Research (NAR) in 2010. Since that date it’s usage is in constant increase.  More than 650 users are currently registered to the web server (51% academic from countries out of France, 39% academic from France and 10% from private sector). Note that MetExplore can also be accessed without any registration, so we can estimate that the number of users world wide is more than 1000. Trianing is a key component in MetExplore outreach. Since 2012, 491 scientists had been trained during 16 (international) and 13 (France) individual or group trainings. 

Positioning: At national level, MetExplore is strongly involved in MetaboHub (French infrastructure for metabolomics and fluxomics) which provided fundings to ensure system robustness and new feature additions. MetExplore had also been part of H2020 PhenoMeNal project (creating a virtual research environement for clinical phenotyping). MetExplore is strongly related to resources in Elixir: Biomodels (networks available in this resource can be uploaded to MetExplore), Metabolights (MetExploreViz is currently used in MetaboLights for dataset visualization in metabolic networks) and Microscope (networks curated on this platform can be viewed and analysed in MetExplore). MetExplore has the potential to be connected to resources related to transcriptomics and proteomics data since genes and proteins related to metabolism are available in genome scale metabolic networks.
MetExplore team members are strongly involved in metabolomics community (Fabien Jourdan is currently president of the French-speaking Metabolomics and Fluxomics Network RFMF). Finally, MetExplore established in 2017 a partnership with a non-academic partner MedDay Pharmaceutical. 
","Tool","MetExplore offers an all-in-one online solution composed of interactive tools for metabolic network curation, network exploration and omics data analysis. In particular, it is possible to curate and annotate metabolic networks in a collaborative environment. The network exploration is also facilitated in MetExplore by a system of interactive tables connected to a powerful network visualisation module. Finally, the contextualisation of metabolic elements in the network and the calculation of over-representation statistics make it possible to interpret any kind of omics data.
MetExplore is a sustainable project maintained since 2010 freely available at https://metexplore.toulouse.inra.fr/metexplore2/. 
","MetExplore is reaching an international audience (51% of academic registered users). Publication in highly visible journals (Nucleic Acids Research and bioinformatics) allows reaching a large community. Outreach activities (more than half of the trainaings are done abroad) are also key elements for international visibility.
Communities served range from biologists (including biochemists) to bioinformaticians (providing ways to curate networks, various import/export solutions and web services). A large scope of application topics can benefit of MetExplore functionalities (human health, food toxicology, biotech, plant-microorganism interactions). Finally, since its first release, MetExplore is tightly connected with metabolomics research community. In fact, MetExplore can be used to enhance metabolic fingerprinting and networks can also contribute to an improved annotation of metabolomics datasets (Frainay et al. 2018 Bioinformatics).
MetExplore is also used by non academic partners (like biotech or pharma companies). For instance, MetExplore is used by the research division of MedDay pharmaceuticals for drug target research in rare brain diseases.
